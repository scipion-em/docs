There are two options to deploy elastic HPC clusters on AWS:

`StarCluster <http://star.mit.edu/cluster>`_
---------------------------------------------

StarCluster is a utility developed by MIT for creating and managing distributed
computing clusters hosted on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

Detailed information about StarCluster can be found on its web site but the
following step-by-step guide shows how to deploy ScipionCloud on Amazon's EC2.

* First you need to install StarCluster client on your  machine, which is used to create and manage the clusters.
  Follow instructions on the StarCluster `installation page <http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/latest/installation.html>`_

The fastest way is to use Python PIP:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo easy_install StarCluster

It is recommended to update it to the latest version from git:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/jtriley/StarCluster.git
    cd StarCluster
    sudo python setup.py install

You might need to install the following packages: ``python-dev, libffi-dev, libssl-dev``. +
Execute StarCluster help and choose second option to create the configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster help
    StarCluster - (http://star.mit.edu/cluster)
    Software Tools for Academics and Researchers (STAR)
    Please submit bug reports to starcluster@mit.edu
    cli.py:87 - ERROR - config file /home/user/.starcluster/config does not exist`
    Options:
    --------
    [1] Show the StarCluster config template
    [2] Write config template to /home/user/.starcluster/config
    [q] Quit
    Please enter your selection:

    *   Then you need to edit StarCluster configuration file and customize it for your needs. StarCluster provides a http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/latest/quickstart.html[quick installation guide] that is good enough to start, although extensive documentation can be found at its site. +
        The following example shows how to customize it for a ScipionCloud cluster with two _t2.medium_ nodes (only some parameters are shown, the rest can be left with their default value). +
        Add a scipioncluster template (or other name you like) that will be used as default template.
        Also, enable experimental features (load balancer for elastic clusters, explained later).

.. code-block:: bash

    ####################################
    ## StarCluster Configuration File ##
    ####################################
    [global]
    DEFAULT_TEMPLATE=scipioncluster
    # enable experimental features for this release
    ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=True

* Replace AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_USER_ID with yours, managed on Security Credentials/Access keys and Account settings. +
* Select AWS region (ScipionCloud AMI currently exists only on AWS EU Ireland region).

.. code-block:: bash

    #############################################
    ## AWS Credentials and Connection Settings ##
    #############################################
    [aws info]
    # replace these with your AWS keys
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = XXXXXXXXXXXX
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    # replace this with your account number (found on account settings)
    AWS_USER_ID= XXXXXXXXX

    AWS_REGION_NAME = eu-west-1
    AWS_REGION_HOST = ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com


Specify the key pair to use (managed on EC2 / Security Groups / Key pairs)

.. code-block:: bash

    ###########################
    ## Defining EC2 Keypairs ##
    ###########################
    [key scipion-key]
    KEY_LOCATION=~/scipion-key.rsa

Define the scipioncluster template: +
Set the cluster size and the instance image and type (although starcluster allows different images and types for master and node, current Scipion AMI is unique for both). +
The list of instance types might not be updated on the config file, you can
check them `[here] <https://github.com/I2PC/scipion/wiki/AWS-Instance-Types-for-Starcluster>`_
You might also want to choose a prefix for the machine names. +
Although not necessary it is recommended to attach an external EBS storage.
Just uncomment the VOLUMES parameter and create a volume section as explained
`[here] <https://github.com/I2PC/scipion/wiki/ScipionCloud-on-Amazon-Web-Services-EC2#using-external-ebs-volumes.>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    [cluster scipioncluster]
    KEYNAME = scipion-key
    # number of ec2 instances to launch
    CLUSTER_SIZE = 2
    # Uncomment to prepent the cluster tag to the dns name of all nodes created
    # using this cluster config.  ie: mycluster-master and mycluster-node001
    # If you choose to enable this option, it's recommended that you enable it in
    # the DEFAULT_TEMPLATE so all nodes will automatically have the prefix
    DNS_PREFIX = True
    # image id correspoding to ScipionCloud-1.2-beta AMI
    NODE_IMAGE_ID = ami-811e79f8
    NODE_INSTANCE_TYPE = t2.medium
    PERMISSIONS = http, https
    #VOLUMES = scipion_data

Configure Security Group permissions.

.. code-block:: bash

    ############################################
    ## Configuring Security Group Permissions ##
    ############################################
    # open port 80 on the cluster to the world
    [permission http]
    IP_PROTOCOL = tcp
    FROM_PORT = 80
    TO_PORT = 80

    # open https on the cluster to the world
    [permission https]
    IP_PROTOCOL = tcp
    FROM_PORT = 443
    TO_PORT = 443
    ----

* Start the cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster start my-scipion-cluster

* Log in to the cluster using ubuntu account
  Your URL and VNC password will be printed on the terminal.

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster sshmaster -u ubuntu my-scipion-cluster

* As explained for a single Scipion instance, you can now go to your browser and access the virtual machine through a remote desktop:
  https:///master-ip/vnc.html where master-ip can be seen either on the EC2 console or executing the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster listclusters

Look for your cluster and get the master IP address from the list of cluster nodes (in this example 54-229-188-230).

.. code-block:: bash

    my-scipion-cluster (security group: @sc-my-scipion-cluster)
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Launch time: 2016-06-15 14:16:49
    Uptime: 0 days, 00:19:47
    VPC: vpc-8f99f4ea
    Subnet: subnet-36480d41
    Zone: eu-west-1a
    Keypair: scipion-key
    EBS volumes: N/A
    Cluster nodes:
        my-scipion-cluster-master running i-98351812 ec2-54-229-188-230.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
        my-scipion-cluster-node001 running i-99351813 ec2-54-229-182-132.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
    Total nodes: 2

* To stop the cluster (and stop being charged) use starcluster too (if you do it through the EC2 console you mess up starcluster own record!).

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster stop my-scipion-cluster

* To restart the cluster you just need to type:

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster start -x my-scipion-cluster

* To terminate the cluster (and delete VMs but not EBS external volumes)

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster terminate my-scipion-cluster

Using external EBS volumes on the cluster
------------------------------------------

For the cluster approach the use of an external EBS volume has to be defined on the starcluster configuration file since the attached volume should be shared by all nodes on the cluster.

The volume has to exist and be formatted before it can be attached to the
cluster. This can be done through EC2 dashboard or using starcluster client as
explained `here <http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/latest/manual/volumes.html#create-and-format-a-new-ebs-volume>`_.

Then it has to be added to the cluster template (if more than one volume is
added separate it by commas):

.. code-block:: bash

    VOLUMES = scipion_data

and also defined:

.. code-block:: bash

    #############################
    ## Configuring EBS Volumes ##
    #############################
    [volume scipion_data]
    VOLUME_ID = vol-3be6f5c9
    MOUNT_PATH = /data

Then any cluster created will mount that volume on the path selected.
When the cluster is terminated the EBS volume will persist and could be attached to another cluster.

Elastic cluster
----------------

StarCluster provides a experimental feature, called Elastic Load Balancer, that can be used to balance clusters dynamically depending on the batch system workload (Sun Grid Engine).
To use it you need a cluster running as explained above.
Detailed documentation can be found `[here] <http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/latest/manual/load_balancer.html>`_ but the basic usage is as follows:

To start balancing:

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster loadbalance my-scipion-cluster

This will keep the cluster size between 1 and CLUSTER_SIZE limits depending on the batch system workload.
This limits can be changed by passing them as parameters to the loadbalance command, for instance:

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster loadbalance -m 20 -n 2 my-scipion-cluster

This will create up to 20 nodes if the load requires it and will keep a minimum of 2 nodes.

To see a list of all the parameters that can be passed to the loadbalance just type:

.. code-block:: bash

    starcluster loadbalance --help

The following image, extracted from Starcluster documentation, shows the workflow for each loadbalance loop.

.. figure:: http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/latest/_images/balancer_decision_diagram.jpg

   :width: 500
   :alt: Starcluster Loadbalance

Another interesting parameter to tun up is the maximum time to wait until a node is added (-w option). The default value is 900 seconds (15  minutes) which might be too long.

AWS CfnCluster
--------------
It is and open-source tool developed by AWS that allows to create and configure an elastic HPC cluster on AWS EC2. +
We have not yet tested it with ScipionCloud but an easy How-to can be
found `here <https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/deploy-elastic-hpc-cluster/>`_.
