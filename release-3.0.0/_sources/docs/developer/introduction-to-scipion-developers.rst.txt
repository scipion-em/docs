-------------------------------------

If you are new to Scipion, you will find useful to follow this steps:

#.  Read the :doc:`project definition <project-definition>`. After this, you
    should have a better idea of the context of our work and what Scipion is
    and which are the motivations behind. Don't worry if you feel a bit lost
    with so much information, you can read this again.
#.  Read the :doc:`Scipion Architecture <architecture>` to have an idea
    of the "big picture" of the project. You should know the basic
    components of Scipion and how they interact.
#.  Learn how to configure :doc:`Pycharm <pycharm>` before start developing
    in Scipion. Pycharm is the IDE that we use, but you sould be able to use
    your preferred one.
#.  Read some :doc:`basic tips about git <how-to-git>`. We use *git* as our
    versioning system, so it will be useful to have a basic knowledge about
    it.
#.  Read the style guide to start coding :doc:`Python <python-style-guide>`.
    The style is very important in order to write clear and readable code as
    a team.

    messages, etc.
