Symmetries
===========================

Overview
========

This page describes the different symmetries
that a polyhedron with fixed center may have
and the symmetry conventions followed by Scipion. There are five fundamental symmetry classes: cyclical, dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral and
icosahedral. Auxiliary data used to create this page is available at https://github.com/I2PC/testDataSym .

For each type we show in this page:

- Surface rendering of a volume that displays the symmetry.
- Atomic structure file (pb format) containing an atomic structure that
  satisfies the symmetry. (The PDB files may be visualized with
  viewers such as Chimera. `Link </docs/docs/images/Conventions/Symmetry/axis.bild>`_ to chimera axis file).
- Definition including the elements of symmetry.
- *X*, *Y* and *Z* axes are colored in red, yellow and blue respectively.
- Nomal vectors to the planes that define the unit cell.

Note: Is really hard to see the difference symmetries just looking to the images,
instead download the PDB files, the axis.bild file and visualize them in chimera.
In chimera command line type "represent sphere" to increase the atoms size.

         I guess the result for DNx is valid here but I do not have the software to test this claim.
