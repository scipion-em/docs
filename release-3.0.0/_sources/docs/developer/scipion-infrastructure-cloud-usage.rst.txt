If you want to use Chimera you should install it through the Plugin Manager.

To copy your data in the virtual server you can use rsync but the destination folder should be located inside the ScipionUserData directory which is the mounting point of the bigger storage disk.

As an example you should launch a similar command from the server where your data and project is located:

rsync -av Instruct_project_1234 scipionuser@IP.OF.THE.SERVICE:ScipionUserData/projects/

Depending on your data size data will take some time to copy but you can login and start working on it.

You might then continue working on the project until you reach your results.


The infrastructure setup has a limited time but in case you need more time you could request it sending an email to i2pc and an extension might be granted depending on the pending requests.

In any case you will have some time to download project and results.
