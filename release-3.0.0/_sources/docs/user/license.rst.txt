Licenses
========
All scipion code and plugins, are licensed under the GPL3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

Now, Scipion interacts, and in some cases installs 3rd party software with its own LICENCE that must be observed.

So, it is under the user responsability to check the license of each of the software scipion is installing.

In most cases, if not all, software is free available for academic use and industry but there are few exceptions where industry users are not granted for a free usage.
You must check eacho of the cases.
