Introduction to Model building with ModelAngelo
===============================================

Model building is the process that allows getting the atomic
interpretation of an electron density map. Although an electron density volume can be obtained from different methodologies, in this tutorial we focus on maps obtained by cryo-EM.
ModelAngelo predicts the three-dimensional struture of a protein using a 3D cryoEM- derived map as input and, optionally, its amino acid sequence, using a deep learning system algorithm
:cite:p:`jamali2023modelangelo`. Using a deep learning algorithm, ModelAngelo is able to find a model even if no homologous sequences are available. 
 
With this tutorial we are going to learn:

* How to build a protein atomic model using ModelAngelo using a 3D cryo-EM map as input, with and without its amino acid sequence.
* How to compare ModelAngelo predicted structures with the structures already traced and published for the same proteins.
