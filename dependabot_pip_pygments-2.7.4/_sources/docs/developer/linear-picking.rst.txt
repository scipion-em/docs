Linear/helical picking
=======================

There is now a new picking mode in Xmipp picker: the "Linear mode". We believe it will help you to pick filaments or helix like structures.

You can easily pick particles in a linear mode like this.

We thought we could improve the cursors, we hope you like the new "look and feel".

We've also created some shortcuts to easy change from one mode to another. If you press "E" it will activate deactivate the eraser. If you press "L" it will activate/deactivate the linear picking. See the picking help window to discover many other keyboard shortcuts.
