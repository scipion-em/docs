Icons
~~~~~

The icon set used in the project is `Font Awesome <http://fontawesome.io/>`_.
Font Awesome is fully open source and is GPL compatible. In
the web the icons are defined through a css class while in the desktop
app any new icon has to be generated from the `Font Awesome Cheatsheet <http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/>`_. In order to
generate these icons you will have to install the FontAwesome.otf and
copy&paste the icons in Photoshop. A brief explanation can be found in
the link aforementioned.

Typography
-----------

The default font type and family to be used is Helvetica. Font sizes and
decorations can be used to emphasize when required (using bold and/or
italics). The default size is 11 and the font style is plain. However if
needed it can be changed to emphasize, as well.

Color Palette
--------------

These are the main colors you should use in Scipion. Although you can
find some other colors in Scipion they are usually used with purpose
design. Therefore you should not use these or any other new colors
unless it was extremely necessary.
