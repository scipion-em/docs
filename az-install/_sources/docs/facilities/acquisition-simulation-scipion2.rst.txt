=============================
API scripting demo (Scipion2)
=============================

This tutorial try to put into practice the previous facilities sections
by means of a demo which simulates a whole cryo-EM acquisition session.

This tutorial is intended to be follow using Scipion2

The demo is made of the following 5 logical steps:

1. `Simulating a cryo-EM acquisition <acquisition-simulation#id1>`_
   by taking movies from a data set to deposit it in a simulated deposition
   directory, one by one every a certain time step.
2. `Launching a wizard <acquisition-simulation#wizard-for-user-parameters>`_
   asking for some parameters that the user can set.
3. `Creating the workflow <acquisition-simulation#creating-custom-workflows>`_
   according to that user and config parameters.
4. `Launching and opening that workflow <acquisition-simulation#launch-and-open-projects>`_.
5. `Customizing the HTML report <customize-html-report>`_.

Notice that these 5 steps are independent one each other. Moreover,
each of them can be done in different ways and, this demo wants to be just an
example of how to do them. However, we will give some hints of alternative
procedures.

This demo uses a set of scripts from our `em-facilities script-sharing repository
<https://github.com/I2PC/em-facilities>`_, thus clone the repository to be able
to run this demo

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/I2PC/em-facilities


0. Config file
--------------

First of all, it is very useful to have a file where to store some parameters
which usually remains constant for a certain configuration/system/PC/facility.
We call this file **config file**.

For instance, the `usingAPI-demo/scipionbox.conf <https://github.com/I2PC/
em-facilities/blob/master/usingAPI_demo/scipionbox.conf>`_ file contains
some constant parameters useful for this demo

.. code-block:: bash

    [GLOBAL]
    DEPOSITION_PATH = ~/microDepositions
    PATTERN = *.mrcs
    GAIN_PAT = gain.mrc
    SCIPION_PROJECT = ~/ScipionUserData/projects
    SIMULATION = True
    RAWDATA_SIM = ~/ScipionUserData/testData/betagalMovies
    NUM_CPU = 64

    [MICROSCOPE]
    AMP_CONTR = 0.1
    SPH_AB = 2.7
    VOL_KV = 300
    SAMPLING = 0.637
    TIMEOUT = 1*60
    INV_CONTR = True
    PARTS2CLASS = 3000

We can see two sections *Global* and *Microscope* getting the following parameters.

* *Global*:
    * *DEPOSITION_PATH*: Where Scipion will look for movies.
    * *PATTERN*: The bash pattern that all movies have to match to be imported.
    * *GAIN_PAT*: The bash pattern that the gain must match to be used (it must
      also be at the *deposition path* in this case).
    * *SCIPION_PROJECT*: Where to store the Scipion project.
    * *SIMULATION*: If ``True``, a `simulation <acquisition-simulation#id1>`_ is
      performed by means of linking files from *RAWDATA_SIM* to
      *DEPOSITION_PATH* every certain time. If ``False``, no simulation is done
      and *DEPOSITION_PATH* is expected to be automatically full.
    * *RAWDATA_SIM*: Where to find a data set to be used for the simulation
      (ignored if ``False`` in the previous point).
    * *NUM_CPU*: Number of system CPUs to optimize the workflow.

* *MICROSCOPE*:
    * *AMP_CONTR*: Amplitude contrast of the microscope.
    * *SPH_AB*: Spherical aberration of the microscope (in *mm*).
    * *VOL_KV*: Working microscope voltage (in *kV*).
    * *SAMPLING*: Sampling rate (in *A/px*).
    * *TIMEOUT*: General `timeout <https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/docs/facilities/
      facilities-workflows.html#streaming-workflows>`_ for the streaming mode and,
      if *SIMULATION* is ``True``, the simulated acquisition rate (in *s*).
    * *INV_CONTR*: If ``True`` a contrast inversion is done before picking.
      If ``False``, no inversion of contrast is done.
    * *PARTS2CLASS*: Number of particles to wait before to perform a 2D
      classification of a first batch.

If you think that some of these parameters are not so constant, you could not
include it and, then ask for it `using a wizard <acquisition-simulation#
wizard-for-user-parameters>`_ or the option you consider.
Also, here we have included some workflow dependent parameter such as
the *PART2CLASS*. You are free to put more or less parameters here, just have
in mind that they are parameters that rarely change from one acquisition to the
next.


1. Acquisition simulation
-------------------------

This point is just to simulate a periodically getting of movies. Nothing else.
If you intend to run in a real acquisition, you can skip this point.

The script `usingAPI-demo/simulate_acquisition.py <https://github.com/I2PC/em-facilities/blob/master/usingAPI_demo/simulate_acquisition.py>`_
in the cloned repository

.. code-block:: bash

    Usage: simulate_acquisition.py INPUT_PATTERN OUTPUT_FOLDER [GAIN_FILE] [DELAY]

            INPUT_PATTERN: input pattern matching input files.
            OUTPUT_FOLDER: where to create the output links.
            [GAIN_FILE, default None]: gain file will be linked at the beginning
            [DELAY, default 30]: delay in seconds between file appearance

makes symbolic links of those files matching *INPUT_PATTERN* to *OUTPUT_FOLDER*
every *DELAY* seconds. If a *GAIN_FILE* is found, it is linked first.


2. Wizard for user parameters
-----------------------------

Every acquisition have singularities from the others. That singularities can be
from the sample type, from the user preferences, from the EM operator preferences,
from the resources availability or, even, from the microscope status.
Then, we should have some flexibility to process the sample, but first of all,
we need to know this singularities.

In this demo, we have re-used the GUI code in Scipion for creating a wizard in
order to ask for all these parameters that can be different from one acquisition
to the other. However, every facility can develop its own way to retrieve these
(or others) parameters, such as a web form, using the facilities booking system...
We refer to that parameters as *user parameters*.

The code of this wizard can be found in
`usingAPI-demo/form_launcher.py <https://github.com/I2PC/em-facilities/blob/master/usingAPI_demo/form_launcher.py>`_
in the cloned repository.
We have design this script in four logical steps:

* `Reading the config file <https://github.com/I2PC/em-facilities/blob/8a31f7f5eed3dc73443266272c40b1da6432135d/
  usingAPI_demo/form_launcher.py#L470-L510>`_.
* `Creating the wizard window using some Scipion-tkinter classes as base
  <https://github.com/I2PC/em-facilities/blob/8a31f7f5eed3dc73443266272c40b1da6432135d/
  usingAPI_demo/form_launcher.py#L49-L133>`_.
* `Filling the wizard with the fields <https://github.com/I2PC/em-facilities/blob/
  8a31f7f5eed3dc73443266272c40b1da6432135d/usingAPI_demo/form_launcher.py#L135-L230>`_.
* `Retrieving the parameters <https://github.com/I2PC/em-facilities/blob/8a31f7f5eed3dc73443266272c40b1da6432135d/
  usingAPI_demo/form_launcher.py#L235-L394>`_.

The wizard can be launched by running

.. code-block:: bash

    scipion python em-facilities/usingAPI-demo/form_launcher.py

.. figure:: /docs/images/facilities-API-wizard.png

All the default values in the **Pre-processing** section
(also in the `scipionbox.conf <acquisition-simulation.html#config-file>`_)
are thought to be used with the beta-galactosidase sample (`EMPIAR 10061
<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/empiar/entry/10061>`_ dataset).
However, you can play setting the parameters in some way or adjusting them
to your single data.

For instance:

* We know that this sample belongs to the ``d2`` **symmetry group** and
  this will be used to estimate the initial model, however one can introduce any
  other symmetry group.
* This movies have 16 frames, thus you cat skip some of them by indicating a
  certain **Frames range**.
* If a certain **Number of mics to manual pick** is set, the workflow will wait
  until this number is reached before launching the manual picker. If 0 is set,
  only automatic picking is done and the particle size is estimated by *Xmipp*.
* We can add optional protocols, such as *Optical flow* to do a high order local
  movie alignment, *Eman2-Sparx* to automatic picking, or adding more initial
  volume reconstruction methods to the *Xmipp swarm init. vol. consensus* protocol,
  such as *Xmipp Ransac* and/or *Eman Initial Volume*.
  Note that *Xmipp Significance* is always used to estimate the initial model.

For the **GPU usage** section, note that all the protocols in the workflow will
be running in parallel at the same time, then only one GPU id can be attached
to one single protocol to prevent GPU concurrence crashes.

Now, we are able to start the processing over the simulation acquisition
by clicking on **Create New Session**.


3. Creating custom workflows
----------------------------

Once we know all the parameters that will be used, we must create the workflow
accordingly. At this point there are two options:

* Fill a *JSON* file with all the protocols parameters accordingly with the
  previous section.
* Use the `Scipion's API <https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/api/pyworkflow.html>`_
  to create a new project and adding every protocol accordingly to the previous
  section.

You can code a script to fill a *JSON* file according to all what Scipion expect.
Although, a good option to go with the *JSON* way is to choose a certain
*JSON* file from a stored set of templates, according to the user answers.

However, in this tutorial we have choose to develop a Python script using the
Scipion's API to create the project and to add all the protocols according to
the wizard described in the previous section.

See `how to create workflows with the API <facilities-API-demo>`_ to continue.


4. Launch and open projects
---------------------------

Launch a project
================

See `launching JSON workflows <facilities-workflows#static-templates>`_ if
you crated a JSON file.

In case of API workflows, if the protocols included in the workflow made in the
previous section are `saved instead of launched <facilities-API-demo#
registering-protocols>`_, we must to launch the whole
workflow at once by

.. code-block:: bash

    scipion python $SCIPION_HOME/pyworkflow/project/scripts/schedule.py projectName

where ``projectName`` is the name of the project made in the previous section.
Alternatively, the whole workflow can also be launch from the GUI by selecting
the *Import Movies > right-click > Restart workflow*.

Note that if the protocols have been launched during the workflow creation, this
step must be skipped.

Open a project
==============

To open a project you can either open the Scipion GUI and choose the project
from the project window or just run

.. code-block:: bash

    scipion project projectName


5. Customize the HTML report
----------------------------

The *HTML* report can be customized to the facilities' needs. It haven't be
customized every acquisition but just once. However, we include here
`how to customize the HTML report <customize-html-report>`_.
