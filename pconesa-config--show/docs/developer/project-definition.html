<p>Scipion is an image processing framework for obtaining 3D models of
macromolecular complexes using Electron Microscopy (3DEM). It is
designed to integrate several software packages in the field and present
a unified interface for both biologists and developers. Scipion allows
the execution of workflows combining different software tools, while
taking care of formats and conversions. Additionally, all steps are
tracked and can be reproduced later on.</p>

<p>Structural biology aims at the visualization of microscopic biological
structures with the ultimate goal of understanding the molecular
mechanisms taking place in the healthy cell as well as in the pathological
cell. This spatial information is crucial to correctly put in context
the biochemical information obtained by other experimental means. The
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) is a powerful tool for acquiring
three-dimensional structural information at two different structural
levels: the macromolecular level (visualization of proteins or protein
complexes [Frank2006a]) and the subcellular level
(visualization of thin cellular sections; [Frank2006b]).
The resolution (understood as the smallest reliable detail in the
volume) at the macromolecular level ranges between 4 and 20 Å, while in
the second case between 20 and 50 Å for sections thinner than 0.5 μm.</p>
<p>Three-dimensional structure of a wide range of biological specimens can
be computed from images collected by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). This information, integrated with structural data obtained with
other techniques (e.g., X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic
resonance), helps biologists to understand the function of
macromolecular complexes and organelles within cells. This kind of
analysis have allowed to experimentally visualize the molecule
trafficking through the nuclear pore complex (the communication between
the cell nucleus and the cell cytoplasm) and the structure of each
protein involved [Beck2004, Robinson2007], the mechanism
of cell infection by certain viruses [Zhang2010], the
capsid structure of the dengue virus [Pokidysheva2006], or
the structure of several proteins below 4 Å
[Ludtke2008, Zhang2008].</p>
<p>Some of the most common uses of the TEM are the visualization of
macromolecular complexes, using a technique known as single-particle
analysis (SPA), the visualization of up to 0.5-1 micron thick cellular
components (or sections), using electron tomography (ET), the
determination of the arrangement of atoms in solids using Electron
Crystallography and complemented by X-ray Crystallography and two
special cases of SPA where symmetry has a crucial impact: helical
structures and icosahedral viruses. This project is primarily focused
on the first two techniques although it will be designed in such a way
that the remaining techniques will be easily included in the near
future.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Single-particle analysis (SPA) is a 3D-TEM method, used for studies of
macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies whose structure and dynamic
interactions can be analysed in vitro (e.g., proteins, ribosomes,
viruses) [Sorzano2007, Jonic2008]. This method is very
powerful and under a permanent development. It is complementary to
nuclear magnetic resonance, since it allows computing a global structure
of large macromolecular assemblies (size &gt; 10 nm, molecular mass &gt; 200
kDa). It is also complementary to X-ray crystallography, since it allows
the study of non-crystalline matter. Generally speaking, SPA uses a large
number of random “snapshots” of individual molecules to reconstruct the
3D structure. In practice, the analysis starts with two-dimensional (2D)
TEM images of thousands of individual molecules of the same type taken
in random orientation. Complex image processing algorithms and huge
computing power are then required to reconstruct the 3D structural
features of the macromolecules. When an even distribution of single
particles orientations is observed on the specimen grid, and the
population is structurally and conformationally homogeneous, standard
image processing strategies allow computing a 3D average structure of
the studied particles at near-atomic resolution (4-10 Å)
[Ludtke2008, Zhang2008].</li>
<li>Electron tomography (ET) is a relatively recently introduced technique
that allows the visualization of thin cellular sections (up to 0.5μm
thick, while the whole cell may be 10 to 30 times larger) with a
resolution around 30-40 Å [Lucic2006, Jonic2008]. This is
achieved by tilting the specimen within the electron microscope and
acquiring projection images that are reconstructed using a standard
tomographic algorithm. In this way, the macromolecules observed by SPA
can be seen in their native context (see Fig. 3). This has given rise to
the emerging of the field of Visual Proteomics
[Nickell2006]. Image processing algorithms have been
devised for the identification and location of proteins in the electron
tomogram [Frangakis2002].</li>
<li>Electron Crystallography, in which the complexes are regularly arranged
in a two-dimensional crystal lattice.</li>
<li>Helical reconstruction, in which the macromolecules are regularly arranged
in a helical, tubular structure.</li>
<li>Icosahedral virus reconstruction, in which the molecules to study are located in an
icosahedral virus capsid. Although the orientation of each virus in each
image is random, the high internal symmetry of the virus capsid allows
the achievement of high resolution.</li>
<li>X-ray microscopy allows the visualization of the whole cell in a
near-native state at a resolution around 150 Å. The energy of the X-ray
photons is located within the water window (from the absorption edge of
carbon at 284 eV to the absorption edge of oxygen at 534 eV). Within
this energy region, the biological structures (lipids and proteins)
absorb 10 times more than the surrounding water or ice. In this way, the
sample is visualized in a near-native state without the need of any
dye, which might modify the internal structure of the cell. Moreover, the
high penetration power of X-ray photons allows imaging up to 15 μm,
i.e., the whole thickness of a single cell
[Schneider1998, LeGros2005]. Photons in this energy region
are called soft X-rays, as compared to hard X-rays (e.g. used in medical
radiographs) ranging between 20 and 150 keV. Using a synchrotron as the
source of the soft X-rays provides an extremely bright light source as
compared to other X-ray emitting devices. The design of the microscope
is highly tuned to the X-ray photon energy window, and currently there
are only two microscopes in the world specifically designed for the
water window: one is at the synchrotron of the Lawrence Berkeley Natl.
Lab. (USA) and the other is at the BESSY Synchrotron in Berlin
(Germany). Interestingly, Spain is in a very favorable position in this
area in the global scientific context, since during 2011 it is expected
to start the operations of Mistral, the X-ray Tomography Microscope of
the Spanish synchrotron Alba. In fact, it was our group who defended to
the ALBA Scientific Advisory Committee the creation of this beamline at
the synchrotron, and we are currently participating in its design and
construction.</li>

in Europe under the EU BioImage Project (Coordinated by the BCU of
National Center for Biotechnology) and then followed within TEMBLOR
(Coordinated by the EBI-EMBL), providing access to the reconstructed
maps as well as the conditions in which the sample was prepared and the
data was recorded. Currently the center is operated jointly by the
Protein Databank in Europe (PDBe), at the European Bioinformatics
Institute, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb</a>, the Research Collaboratory
for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do</a>), and the National Center for
Macromolecular Imaging (NCMI, <a class="reference external" href="http://ncmi.bcm.edu/ncmi">http://ncmi.bcm.edu/ncmi</a>). The database
provide a basic description of the biological experiment and sample
preparation as well as the final results obtained after the image
analysis and their relationships to other databases (for instance, the
fittings of domain structures known at atomic resolutions at the
Worldwide Protein Data Bank) [Henrick2003, Tagari2002].
Since 2002, more than 1000 such maps have been deposited by researchers
using a web-based interface and are freely available to the public
through a search interface and an FTP server. A measure of its success is
that many journals request that the authors of 3DEM publications
deposit of the 3D maps in the data base before publication.
Unfortunately, the lack of adherence to a set of common conventions is
hampering the usefulness of this database. Furthermore, small but
important differences in the exact meanings of parameters among
packages handicap users who try to operate with more than one package.</li>
<li>Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wwpdb.org">http://www.wwpdb.org</a>), is a

experiment in a much more detailed manner than the one stored at EMDB.
** Conventions: (3DEM-CWS, <a class="reference external" href="http://conventions.cnb.csic.es">http://conventions.cnb.csic.es</a>) is a web site
that documents whether the map files produced in a particular package
are consistent with the 3DEM conventions [Heymann2005]. It
has been recognized that one of the most difficult obstacles for data
sharing is the different definitions of geometrical conventions
(directions of the axes, rotations, shifts, etc.). To solve these
problems, this work set up a centralized resource where
convention-related information is being collected, stored and tested.</p>

[Philippsen2007]. In principle, this Python layer would

to the best of our knowledge this possibility has not been exploited to
actually build scripts using different packages.

It contains a friendly graphical interface and workflow support. Final

[Baxter2007]. It also contains a database that aims at
providing some level of traceability to the processing workflow and some

structural biologists.</li>

web-based application and Python scripting system allowing the analysis
of single particles with several software packages (Eman, Imagic,

(<a class="reference external" href="http://ami.scripps.edu/redmine/projects/leginon/wiki">http://ami.scripps.edu/redmine/projects/leginon/wiki</a>), a system
designed for automated collection of images from a transmission electron
microscope [Suloway2005]. Appion can be seen as a
“pipeline” with registered input and output data that provide
user guidance through the whole process. The program grew from the
specific laboratory needs, practices and customs of a specific
laboratory and it may be difficult to generalize it to fully cover
several packages, different and reusable workflows, etc. Low performance
and lack of a friendly interface and installation process are some of
the weak points of its current implementation. However, Appion has an
important pioneering value and, furthermore, concrete plans exist to
extend and generalize its functionalities. We acknowledge the key value
of their current experience as well its inspirational role.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Motivation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM) allows imaging of large
biological macromolecules nearly in their native state. Different
techniques have been developed within the last forty years to process
the EM data and, not surprisingly, success in EM particle analysis is
highly correlated with the continuous development of various image
processing packages. Still, a severe lack of image and volume processing
standards is preventing 3DEM from becoming a high throughput (HT),
“-omics-like” technique, capable of generating rich biological databases
on which a new step of discovery through data mining could be
attempted. The workflows proposed by the different EM reconstruction
packages are similar and, therefore, it should be easy to exploit the
different strengths of each package. But, in practice, relatively small
differences between format and conventions due to the lack of
standardization in the field heavily penalize users. This proposal
aims at establishing a firm basis for solving some of the main burdens
related to 3DEM data processing, such as the interoperability between
different software packages and the current steep image processing
learning curve, key issues that are preventing a more widespread use of
3DEM in biology at large. Furthermore, this work will open many new
standardization issues such as the definition of interchange formats as
well as processing workflows involving several EM packages, together
with the development of new image processing ontologies. We will fully
exploit the possibility of defining standardized workflows and running
them in the ecosystem of high-performance computational infrastructures
that has been developed over the recent years in Europe, thereby minimizing
the image analysis time and maximizing the throughput
capabilities of 3DEM. Ultimately, the combination of efficient EM
workflows with utility computing will create completely new scientific
collaborative environments and thus enable new science.</p>
<p>Each technique (we will mainly focus on electron tomography, electron
crystallography, helical reconstruction, icosahedral virus reconstruction, and X-ray
tomography) has a set of software packages allowing the reconstruction
of the three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional images
(to mention the most widespread ones: Spider
[Frank1996], Imagic [vanHeel1996], MRC
package [Crowther1996], IMOD [Kremer1996],
Brandeis helical package [Owen1996], Eman
[Ludtke1999], Bsoft [Heymann2001], Xmipp
[Sorzano2004], Tom Toolbox [Nickell2005],
2dx [Gipson2007], and TomoJ
[Messaoudi2007]). Some packages cover several techniques
at the same time (Spider, Imagic, Bsoft, Xmipp), while others are
specific to a single one (MRC package, IMOD, Brandeis helical package,
Eman, Tom Toolbox, TomoJ). Current software suites for the analysis of
these kinds of images are actually composed by hundreds of small programs,
each one performing an “atomic” task, which must be assembled into a
script constituting the image processing pipeline. Inexperienced users
get lost during the reconstruction process, so the development of
standard and controlled sequences of actions will be of great help to
the community; we will refer to these sequences as “workflows”.
Workflows should be defined at the logical level and should be independent
of any particular piece of software. In general, users understand the
workflows but get confused with programs that implement these workflows.
So it may be considered a good idea to hide the workflow implementation
whenever possible, but it is clear that to properly process the data, it
is necessary to understand what is being done. Therefore, it is not
possible to fully hide the implementation; still, many of the user’s
troubles appear because the software developed in scientific
environments lacks well defined interfaces and therefore is not easy to
use outside the place and moment in which it was created. Moreover, the
programs are usually called through UNIX shells, which imposes another
important entrance barrier to the novice. Learning to use each program
suite takes a few months, and experimentalists are reluctant to
change from one package to the next due to the steep learning curve of
each one.</p>
<p>These scripts are usually run several times, varying the parameters
among the different executions until the best reconstruction is
obtained. The traceability of the process relies purely on the lab
notebooks of the user and his/her good practices, and sometimes the
reproducibility of the final reconstruction is seriously compromised by
weak notebook annotations. As a result, we have noticed that a few
months after completing a project, the researcher is usually unable to
reproduce their own results work without a major effort. Not only is
accurate data bookkeeping needed, but also the possibility of an
automatic repetition of a given pipeline.</p>
<p>Additionally, image processing pipelines usually lack internal
quality controls, and only the final results are usually controlled
through some measure of resolution. This implies that some of the steps
in the whole process may not be optimal, degrading the overall
performance of the whole pipeline, but there are currently no easy ways
to identify these steps. Only advanced users are able to check the
intermediate results of each step and take the required actions.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Objectives</a><a class="headerlink" href="#objectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We propose to further develop image processing standards, leading to the
design of a software platform for structural biologists who use the
transmission electron microscope such that the process of obtaining the
three-dimensional structure of the biological sample will be greatly
simplified. This platform will integrate tools from the main image
processing software packages and will be built upon a consensus of the
structural biology community. Scipion will keep track of all operations
performed in an image processing LIMS (Laboratory Information Management
System) and will allow access to large computational facilities (HPC and
cloud computing) so that researchers do not need to manage their own
computer cluster or the execute their image analysis in a
supercomputing centre (although these possibilities will also be
explicitly considered in the design as it is the common practice of
advanced users). The platform will also be connected to other data
integration initiatives and will easily extend to other techniques
and packages.</p>
