How to use ScipionCloud
=======================

`ScipionCloud in Amazon Web Services EC2 <scipionCloud-on-amazon-web-services-ec2>`_

`ScipionCloud in the EGI Federated Cloud <scipion-on-the-egi-federated-cloud>`_

Cloud-related projects
=======================

ScipionCloud development has been possible thanks to European Horizon 2020, the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme, which has financed the following projects:

MoBrain
--------
*“A Competence Center to Serve Translational Research from Molecule to Brain”.**

We are involved on **Task 2: Cryo-EM in the cloud: bringing clouds to the data**.

`Information about the project <https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/CC-MoBrain>`_

WestLife
---------

*"Bring the world of complex data analysis in Structural Biology to a simple Web browser-based Virtual Research Environment"*.

The group is responsible for the **Integration of existing Cryo-EM web services, Scipion Web Tools, on the VRE**.

`Westlife Project web site <https://about.west-life.eu>`_

Scipion has been chosen as the main use case to design Westlife architecture as described `[here] <http://internal-wiki.west-life.eu/w/index.php?title=WP4_Scipion_Usecase>`_.

Instruct Research and Development pilot project
-----------------------------------------------

Pilot EM cloud Computing was a project to deploy and test Scipion software on AWS EC2 platform and create a public Scipion AMI that could be used by EM users to easily instantiate its own Scipion Virtual Machine on the AWS cloud.

The aim was to have a standalone Scipion AMI that could be used as a stand-alone or as a elastic cluster.
