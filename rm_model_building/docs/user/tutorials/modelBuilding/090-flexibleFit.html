<p>Although the rigid fitting approximates and atomic , a detailed visual
inspection of and reveals that some residues are not perfectly fitted.
In order to get a better fit, not only of the carbon skeleton but also
of residue side chains, a flexible fitting or refinement has to be
accomplished. Refinement can thus be defined as the optimization process
of fitting parameters to experimental data. Different strategies,
categorized as refinement in the real space and refinement in the
Fourier space, can be followed. Implemented in are two protocols for
real space refinement, (Appendix
<a class="reference external" href="#app:ccp4CootRefinement">[app:ccp4CootRefinement]</a>,
<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">:raw-latex:`\citep{emsley2010}`</span></a>) and (Appendix

computer graphics tool that allows simultaneous display of and fitted to
accomplish mostly interactive modeling operations. Although this
tutorial does not try to show every functionality of , but indicate how
to open, close and save partial and final refined structures in , some
of basic relevant commands will be shown. Initially, we are going to
refine our with . First of all, open the protocol ( (1)), load the map
asymmetric units (2), with electron density normalized to 1 (performs
this step by default), and the fitted structure <span class="math">model</span> (3). To
read the protocol Help is recommended. After executing the protocol (4),
the graphics window will appear to start working.</p>

<div class="line">To check the objects downloaded in , go to the second bar of the main
menu and select . Maps (numbers , and ) and model (number ) are
displayed on the left ( (A)). Remark that you have buttons to display
a particular map (1) and to increase or reduce map density scrolling
it (2). In this case, since we have selected the display of the
unsharpened map asymmetric unit, we can only observe this together
with the . If you want to check any of the sharpened maps, select it
and scroll it. Note that all maps should be aligned. Try to see
differences in details and connectivity of the map to assess if the
sharpened maps really optimize the map density compared to the
unsharpened one. If this is the case, try to follow the refinement
according to the density of the best map (the most optimized one)
checking the reliability of the density according to the unsharpened
map, specially in the most controversial areas. Since you count on
several sharpening maps you can also take advantage of the different
map optimizations that you could have in the distinct areas of the
map.</div>
<div class="line">To start with the refinement process, we are going to identify the
part of <span class="math">model</span> misfitted to the density map. Visual inspection
would clarify this point in some cases, although direct observation of
the might be a shorter way. With this aim, go to the main menu of
graphical window and select . The density fit will be analyzed
regarding a specific map. To select any of them, go to the right side
menu ( (B)(3)) and open the window (C). This density analysis, that
you can see for the three map asymmetric units in ( (D)) shows that
residues 1, 51, 73, 138-142 do not fit perfectly to the density map.
The color range scale goes from green color (good fit) to red color
(bad fit). There are some differences among maps and, as it was
expected, the sharpened maps display higher restraints and show
additional residues partially misfitted.</div>
</div>
<p>According to (B), residue of the new chain does not fit to the map
density. Maybe this residue has been processed post-translationally, as
we have anticipated in <strong>Starting Input data</strong> section. To solve this
question, go to main menu and select ( (A)). residue will be located in
the center of graphics window. Check if this residue is surrounded by
any electron density. As (B)(1) shows, no density associates to the
first chain residue. will thus be deleted. Then go to the lower right
side menu and select the symbol to delete items (B)(2). Select in the
opened window, and click the residue that you want to delete. Go again
to and check if the orange bar shown in residue (B) disappeared.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Although in this particular example the most interesting manual
refinement strategy could be repair only the misfitted residues
because they are very few, in a more general case, in which we could
have many misfitted residues, an initial quick refinement may be
accomplished. With this purpose, first of all, go to the upper right
side menu ( (B)(3)) and select all four restrictions for in the
respective window of parameters. Secondly, open the browser ( (1)) and

and “z” to refine the next upstream 10 residues. Go through those
residues, one by one, and accept refinement if you agree with it. If
you disagree with the refinement of any residue, perform the
interactive refinement, visualizing the residue side chain. Repeat the
refinement process with “z” until the end of the molecule. Check that
the red bar of residue number 53 () goes missing at the end of this
process.</div>
<div class="line">After this partially automatic and partially interactive processing,

enough to look manually for another spatial distribution. Following

but for certain residues we were unable of tracing the lateral side

the (red arrows). The protocol might help us to replace the residues by
the appropriate aminoacids.</p>

<p>After executing the protocol ((8)) we can have a look to the results. By
pressing ((9)) a window with the Viewer menu is opened ((A)). This menu
allows to visualize a certain number of atomic structures, according to
their ranking scores, with lateral side chains fitted in the map density
(1). Those structures will be opened in (2) surrounded by the density
located at 3.0Å of the structure (3). The number shown by default in (1)
allows displaying all atomic structures. By pressing (4) a pop up window
will open and show the score values of each structure, as well as the
average and standard deviation of those values ((B)). If we select the
visualization of a certain number of atomic structures, 5 for example,
as points the red arrow in ((C)), the five best score values will appear
remarked in red in the Summary Plot.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Panel D of the shows the model panel with the five best selected
structures, , , , and . The red arrow points the position of these
indexes. The respective score values are observed in red in (C). (E)
details the view of the five structures in the GUI of (models to ), as
well as the input fragment of ALA (model ). Remark that lateral side
chains are not shown by default. (F) compares this input model with
the best score structure (model ). To display the lateral side chains
select each model and press “Show” in “Atoms” section of the toolbar.
In the same way, (F) compares this input model with the respective
fragment of the structure. To open it as model and align it with the
rest of the structures, write in the comand line:</div>
<div class="line">In spite of some small differences, most of lateral side chains align
quite well with the ones of the model traced on the experimental map.
Then, the best approximation of the atomic structure retrieved (model
) can be selected to help with the tracing of a small fraction of the
density map since the model seems to be quite close to the actual
atomic structure used as control ().</div>

<p>At this point we wonder about the optimal steps to follow in the
refinement process. Should we have to use first, then , then ?, or
maybe, with a different and , should we start with the automatic
refinement and then go to the manual one? The right answer is that there
is no a unique answer. The strategies and the number of steps of
refinement might differ and the only requirement is that the next step
in refinement should generate a better structure than the previous one.
This premise requires to apply common validation criteria to assess the
progressive improvement of our .</p>
