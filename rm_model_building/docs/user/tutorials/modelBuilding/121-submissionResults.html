<p>Although submission of cryoEM maps and derived atomic structures to
databases has to be done by direct online request
(<a class="reference external" href="https://deposit-pdbe.wwpdb.org/deposition/">https://deposit-pdbe.wwpdb.org/deposition/</a>), may contribute to organize
the submission records. The protocol allows to perform this task
(Appendix <a class="reference external" href="#app:exportToEMDB">[app:exportToEMDB]</a>). By using this
protocol we can save the files that you have/want to submit to databases
in a labelled folder and in the appropriate format. details the
protocols of the modeling workflow involved in this task.</p>
<p>When you submit the and the of a <span class="math">cryo-EM</span> experiment, besides
these two records, an image of the is also mandatory to submit. Other
maps, such as half maps or postprocessing-sharpening maps, as well as
maks, are also recommended to submit. In addition, the file is strongly
encouraged. As you can see in , we can provide directly from the
workflow the and the , as well as the two sharpening maps. The image can
be attached from a file. We lack, however, from the file, since the file
is usually generated during the reconstruction process starting from the
half maps, for example with the protocol(, red arrow). To compute the
file we could download the half maps from the database
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/emdb/EMD-3488/index">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/emdb/EMD-3488/index</a>) selecting the

<p>The folder contains the file () and the image () but, unfortunately,
lacks of half maps. Then, you can use any two half maps and compute the
file, just to submit it with the rest of the files.</p>
<p>To save all the relevant files in a single labelled folder, open the
protocol ( (1)), and complete the form with the elements to export: (2),
(3), the two sharpened maps as additional maps (4), the file if you
count on it (5), (6) and (7), previously saved in a known folder. Then,
write the name of the exportation directory path, or find it with the
browser on the right. All submission files will be saved in the selected
(8). A directory name related with the submission (number, date,
project,…) is recommended.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Since the atomic interpretation of a certain macromolecule will be
probably the starting point of relevant mechanistic or biomedical
studies, summaring and organizing our results constitutes the first
step to draw the conclusions that will be made public by journals and
talks. Many different questions can be posed based on the atomic
structure. Here we are wondering about interactions among members of
the macromolecule. To answer this question we have included in the
protocol to identify the residues involved in contacts between any
couple of interacting molecules. “contacts” involve atoms within
favorable interaction distances. Unfavourable contacts or severe
clashes, in which atoms are too close together, although discarded by
default in the final list of ‘contacts’’, may also be shown by using
appropriate advanced parameters, as you can see in Appendix
<a class="reference external" href="#app:chimeraContactsProtocol">[app:chimeraContactsProtocol]</a>.</div>
<div class="line">As an example, in this tutorial we are going to learn how to get atom
contacts of human haemoglobin atomic structure , associated to the
starting map . This structure was already downloaded from by using the
protocol ( (1)). According to the aim of the analysis, two possible
scenarios and the respective workflows can be considered to compute
contacts: a) infering all contacts between any couple of members of
the whole macromolecule ( (3)); b) infering all contacts between any
couple of members of the asymmetric unit, and between one member of
the asymmetric unit and another component from a neighbor asymmetric
unit ( (5)).</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Since the penultimate step of the second workflow ( (4)) requires
applying symmetry, we are going to start moving the structure to match
its symmetry center to the origin of coordinates using the protocol as
we did previously (), including the whole starting map of the human
and the imported atomic structure as and , respectively.</div>
<div class="line">Secondly, we are going to extract the structure of the asymmetric unit
of the docked structure using the protocol as it is indicated in (4).
Complete the protocol form including the last docked structure as .
After executing the protocol, the graphics window will open. You can
select and save the atomic structure of the map asymmetric unit
writing in the command line:</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">CASE A: Contacts between any couple of members of the whole
macromolecule ( (3)):</div>
<div class="line">This option allows to get all contacts between all couples of
members of the macromolecule. In the case of the human we have
depicted all those possible contacts in the (A).</div>
</div>
<p>The protocol can be used to obtain the contacts depicted. Open this
protocol ( (1)) and fill in the first (2) in which no symmetry will
be applied. Include the docked structure (4) as . Use the wizard on
the right to label the molecule chains (5) as they appear in the
adjacent window, and execute the protocol.</p>
<p>After executing the protocol, all atom contacts between the couples
of proteins indicated in (A) can be visualized by clicking ( (A)).</p>
<p>The viewer window of the protocol display different results ((A)):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>box: Final atomic structure considered to compute contacts that
can be visualized with . Press the eye (1) to open the structure
shown on the right.</p></li>
<li><p>box: Summary list of all interacting chains, similar to the list
shown on the right of the (A). Press the eye to open it (2).</p></li>
<li><p>box: In addition to the possibility of changing the order of the
interacting chains in the display, as well as the maximal distance
between residues to group them, this box allows to select couples
of interacting chains (4) and inspect in detail the contacts
between them pressing the eye on the right (3).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">CASE B: Contacts between any couple of members of the asymmetric
unit and ”non-redundant“ contacts between one member of the
asymmetric unit and another one from the neighbor asymmetric unit (
(5)). This second asymmetric unit has been obtained by applying
symmetry with the protocol . Then, “non-redundant” interaction
means any interaction that can not be inferred by symmetry. The (B)
shows the total number of interactions of our example. The
interactions between the chain of the asymmetric unit (model ) and
the chain of the neighbor asymmetric unit (model ) are symmetric to
the interactions between chain of the asymmetric unit (model ) and
chain of the neighbor asymmetric unit (model ). Since those
interactions can thus be inferred by symmetry, they are “redundant”
and are absent of the final list of contacts.</div>
<div class="line">Similarly to the case A, the protocol form has to be open ( (1) )
and completed as indicated in the second (3). Include the
asymmetric unit structure saved with the protocol (6), use the
wizard on the right (7) to label the chains as it is shown on the
right and, finally, include the respective type of symmetry of the
human (8).</div>
<div class="line">Like in the case A, after executing the protocol all non-redundant
atom contacts between any couple of proteins indicated in (B) can
be visualized by clicking ( (B)). Besides the lower number of
contacts displayed, remark that a relevant difference between the
results of the case A and the case B is the final atomic structure
visualized with , which discriminates between the starting
asymmetric unit and the second one generated by symmetry.</div>
<div class="line">: This second possibility of getting protein contacts observed in
the case B is extremely useful when you have a big asymmetric unit,
for example of a virus, and you are interested in contacts among
proteins within the asymmetric unit and with other adjacent
asymmetric units.</div>
