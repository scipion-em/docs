Scipion GUI
===========

This page aims to introduce you in the usage of Scipion GUI. To start
image processing in Scipion we need to run ``scipion`` from the command
line. At first projects manager is displayed and we can create a new
project or select one previously registered (Fig. 1).


.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/new_project.png
    :alt: Create a new project

    Figure 1. Create a new project

Once a project has been selected or a new one is created, a window will open
with its content. In case of being a new one, a window will be displayed as
shown in the following figure.

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/new_project_window.png
    :alt: New project window

    Figure 2. New project window

At this point we will begin to build our processing workflow based on the
protocols provided by Scipion.

Adding a protocol
-----------------

To the left panel, different reconstruction tasks related to Single
Particle Analysis (SPA) are listed. The tree menu is loaded from a
configuration file where protocols are grouped according to base classes,
e.g.: Micrographs Preprocess category displays ProtPreprocessMicrographs
protocols. A protocol is a processing task that involves the execution of several
steps and can be associated to different workflows, e.g.: SPA or Random
Conical Tilt (RCT).

To add a protocol, you would just search for it within the tree and
double-click on it. When you do this, a form will appear with the parameters
that will need to be configured for the protocol execution. The following figure
shows the protocol form ``Import Particles``.

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/import_particles_protocol.png
    :alt: Import particles protocol

    Figure 3. Import particles protocol

Once all its parameters have been configured, we would proceed to its execution
by pressing the ``Execute`` button. After this, the protocol will be shown as
a box in the right panel (Fig 4.).

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/executed_import_particles.png
    :alt: Executed import particles protocol

    Figure 4. Executing a protocol

To the right the sequence of protocols executed by the user and its
state (running, finished, aborted) is listed. We can visualize it using
list or tree views. Starting from Scipion version 1.1 it is possible to create
labels associated with different protocols. You can find more details about :doc:`labels here <labels>`.

Due to the large number of protocols that exist in Scipion, searching the tree
in the left pane is a bit difficult. Another way to add a protocol to our
workflow is by using the protocol browser which is accessed by pressing
``Ctrl-F``. It would only be enough to write a pattern of the
protocol that we want to insert, and the browser will filter for all
the protocols installed in Scipion (Fig. 5). After that, it would
only be enough to select the protocol we are looking for.

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/browser.png
    :alt: Scipion protocol browser

    Figure 5. Scipion protocol browser

Copying a protocol
------------------
We can create copies of one or more protocols(to rerun its) that are in our workflow. It
would only be enough to mark with a ``click`` or several protocols with ``Ctrl-click``
and choose the ``Copy`` option from the task bar that is located above the right
panel(Fig. 4). If only one protocol is selected, when making the copy, its form will
open which we can execute or just save. In case of selecting more than one
protocol, when doing ``Copy``, all the selected protocols will be copied and they
will be shown in ``Save`` state (Fig 6).

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/saving_protocol.png
    :alt: Saving a protocol

    Figure 6. Saving a protocol

Removing a protocol
-------------------
Also we can delete one or more protocols from de workflow. It would only be enough
to select the protocols to delete and choose the delete option from the taskbar.
Before executing this action, Scipion will ask for a confirmation of the
operation (Fig. 7).


.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/removing_protocol.png
    :alt: Removing a protocol

    Figure 7. Removing a protocol


.. note::  These options and others can also be found by ``right-click`` on a
           protocol (Fig. 8).

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/protocol_options.png
    :alt: Protocol options

    Figure 8. Protocol options


Analyzing Results
------------------

Some graphical viewers allow the visualization of the results of the protocols
for later analysis.
Bottom right panel displays information for the selected run, such as inputs
and outputs, execution logs or documentation.
To visualize the outputs of a protocol, Scipion provides the ``Analyze Results``
button. Once it is clicked on, the corresponding viewer for the output object
will open (Fig. 9). This example shows a set of particles.

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/Analize_Results.png
    :alt: Analize Results

    Figure 9. Analize Results

Another way to view a protocol output is by ``Right-click`` on it. The capable
viewers of opening the type of object in question will then appear.
All you have to do is choose one of them and that output will be displayed (Fig. 10).


.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/Viewer_list.png
    :alt: Viewer list

    Figure 10. Viewer list

Waiting for other protocols
---------------------------

Sometimes we need a protocol to finish its execution to be able to launch
another protocol. Scipion protocol forms have a parameter called "Wait for"
(Fig. 11) in which you can specify one or more protocols (protocols IDs
separated by a comma).This protocol starts after the input protocols in the list
are finished. This function will allow you to "schedule" many
runs that will be executed after each other.

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/wait_for.png
    :alt: Prerequisites parameter

    Figure 10. Prerequisites parameter

To better familiarize ourselves with the Scipion GUI, we will use two more
complex projects. More specifically, for this tutorial we registered projects
TestSpiderWorkflow and TestXmippWorkflow for illustrative purposes (running ``scipion tests tests.em.workflows.test_workflow_spiderMDA`` and
``pyworkflow.tests.em.workflows.test_workflow_xmipp``).


Spider Workflow
---------------

If we open TestSpiderWorkflow project GUI is loaded(Fig 9).

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/project.png
    :alt: Project GUI in Protocols Mode

    Figure 12. Project GUI in Protocols Mode

If we switch to Data mode (top right), then left panel displays EM objects registered for
each type and right panel displays project data tree, with protocol
output objects as nodes and edges towards objects used as input. Bottom
right panel displays information for the selected item, that can be
opened using double click. This mode allows us to track image processing
emphasizing on data handling.


.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/datamode.png
    :alt: Project GUI in Data Mode

    Figure 13. Project GUI in Data Mode

TestSpiderWorkflow project imports a set of particles, preprocess and
aligns them to finally use it as input for different 2D classification
algorithms. If we open filter particles protocol (using edit) the
following form is displayed:

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/filter.png
    :alt: Filter Particles Protocol Form

    Figure 14. Filter Particles Protocol Form


Protocol provides cite references and help util to introduce user on the
subject (Fig. 15-16). Form possess two sections: Run and Input. Run
section is common to all protocols and allows the user to configure run
label and comments (to personalize runs, Fig. 14); execution mode
(restart or resume), host, queue and threads or MPI. Many image
processing tasks are computer expensive so they need to be run on
specific hosts, using queue system and parallel processing.
Parallelization can be supported by underneath algorithm or enabled for
protocols with independent steps.

Input section allows to specify input parameters for the task, like
input particles or filter type. A brief description is provided for all
of them (using help button) and for some a Search GUI to select input
object (Fig. 14) or a wizard GUI (through eye button). Parameters are
showed considering expert level selected (Normal, Advanced or Expert).

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/inputlist.png
    :alt: List of SetOfParticles objects registered

    Figure 17. List of SetOfParticles objects registered

We can visualize filtered particles using "Analyze Results" (Fig. 18).
ShowJ viewer is the default viewer for most of Scipion objects, like
images, volumes, sets of images, classes, etc. It can display data in
gallery and table modes and navigate trough different blocks of data.
Also load single images, create subsets, etc. See ShowJ for more detail.
In this project we use it to refine output from a 2D classification
algorithm.

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/particles2.png
    :alt: ShowJ displaying filtered particles

    Figure 18. ShowJ displaying filtered particles

If we select 2D classification protocol ``spider-classify kmeans`` and
open output classes, we can see representative particle for each class
(Fig. 19). Third and fourth items seemed very similar so we can disable
fourth item and create a subset containing only remaining classes. This
operation registers a subset protocol with this classes as input and the
set of classes with enabled items as output.

Xmipp Workflow
--------------

If you open TestXmippWorkflow the following project GUI is displayed
(Fig. 20):

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/xmipp-project.png
    :alt: TestXmippWorkflow Project GUI

    Figure 20. TestXmippWorkflow Project GUI

This project imports a set of micrographs (eg: Fig. 21), reduce its
image size using downsample and estimates their CTF. Then, picks
particles from micrographs and extracts particles to use it as input for
alignment and classification algorithms like cl2d, ml2d, kendersom or
rotational spectra. We use it to illustrate CTF and particle picking
GUIs.


.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/micrograph.png
    :alt: ShowJ displaying input micrograph with "gaussian blur" filter applied

    Figure 21. ShowJ displaying input micrograph with "gaussian blur" filter applied


ShowJ GUI for single images is displayed above (see Showj)

Screen micrographs produces this output:


.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/ctf2.png
    :alt: CTF Recalculate Wizard

    Figure 22. CTF Recalculate Wizard

We can use CTF wizard to redefine input parameters to recalculate CTF on
specific micrographs. Recalculate CTFs will register a new protocol that
receives this SetOfCTF as input and creates an output set with CTFs
updated.

Particle picking can be done in Scipion using Xmipp, Eman, Bsoft, etc.
In this tutorial we chose Xmipp Particle Picker, see Fig. 23.


.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/picking.png
    :alt: Xmipp Particle Picker GUI

    Figure 23. Xmipp Particle Picker GUI

The Xmipp picker allows us to iterate over the micrographs to pick
particles, see :doc:`Picker<picker>`. After we have done
some manual/supervised picking and feel confident with the results we
register output coordinates into Scipion using Add Coordinates button.
