Summary of results and submission
=================================

| Once we have selected the best :math:`model` of the whole human and
  obtained good validation scores from , and other validation programs,
  and we have checked that we have the whole volume density modeled, we
  are ready to submit the electron density map and its atomic
  interpretation to public databases and to make public our results.

Submission to public databases
------------------------------

Although submission of cryoEM maps and derived atomic structures to
databases has to be done by direct online request
(https://deposit-pdbe.wwpdb.org/deposition/), may contribute to organize
the submission records. The protocol allows to perform this task
(Appendix `[app:exportToEMDB] <#app:exportToEMDB>`__). By using this
protocol we can save the files that you have/want to submit to databases
in a labelled folder and in the appropriate format. details the
protocols of the modeling workflow involved in this task.

   databases.

When you submit the and the of a :math:`cryo-EM` experiment, besides
these two records, an image of the is also mandatory to submit. Other
maps, such as half maps or postprocessing-sharpening maps, as well as
maks, are also recommended to submit. In addition, the file is strongly
encouraged. As you can see in , we can provide directly from the
workflow the and the , as well as the two sharpening maps. The image can
be attached from a file. We lack, however, from the file, since the file
is usually generated during the reconstruction process starting from the
half maps, for example with the protocol(, red arrow). To compute the
file we could download the half maps from the database
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/emdb/EMD-3488/index) selecting the
Bundle ( (red arrow)).

The folder contains the file () and the image () but, unfortunately,
lacks of half maps. Then, you can use any two half maps and compute the
file, just to submit it with the rest of the files.

To save all the relevant files in a single labelled folder, open the
protocol ( (1)), and complete the form with the elements to export: (2),
(3), the two sharpened maps as additional maps (4), the file if you
count on it (5), (6) and (7), previously saved in a known folder. Then,
write the name of the exportation directory path, or find it with the
browser on the right. All submission files will be saved in the selected
(8). A directory name related with the submission (number, date,
project,...) is recommended.

After executing the protocol (9), you can check that all files are saved
in the given directory. No additional visualization tools have been
included in this protocol.

Publication of results
----------------------

| Since the atomic interpretation of a certain macromolecule will be
  probably the starting point of relevant mechanistic or biomedical
  studies, summaring and organizing our results constitutes the first
  step to draw the conclusions that will be made public by journals and
  talks. Many different questions can be posed based on the atomic
  structure. Here we are wondering about interactions among members of
  the macromolecule. To answer this question we have included in the
  protocol to identify the residues involved in contacts between any
  couple of interacting molecules. “contacts” involve atoms within
  favorable interaction distances. Unfavourable contacts or severe
  clashes, in which atoms are too close together, although discarded by
  default in the final list of ‘contacts’’, may also be shown by using
  appropriate advanced parameters, as you can see in Appendix
  `[app:chimeraContactsProtocol] <#app:chimeraContactsProtocol>`__.
| As an example, in this tutorial we are going to learn how to get atom
  contacts of human haemoglobin atomic structure , associated to the
  starting map . This structure was already downloaded from by using the
  protocol ( (1)). According to the aim of the analysis, two possible
  scenarios and the respective workflows can be considered to compute
  contacts: a) infering all contacts between any couple of members of
  the whole macromolecule ( (3)); b) infering all contacts between any
  couple of members of the asymmetric unit, and between one member of
  the asymmetric unit and another component from a neighbor asymmetric
  unit ( (5)).

   workflows inside the red box to get contacts between any two chains
   of a macromolecule (3) and between any two chains of the asymmetric
   unit, and between any chain of the asymmetric unit and a chain of a
   neighbor asymmetric unit (5).

| Since the penultimate step of the second workflow ( (4)) requires
  applying symmetry, we are going to start moving the structure to match
  its symmetry center to the origin of coordinates using the protocol as
  we did previously (), including the whole starting map of the human
  and the imported atomic structure as and , respectively.
| Secondly, we are going to extract the structure of the asymmetric unit
  of the docked structure using the protocol as it is indicated in (4).
  Complete the protocol form including the last docked structure as .
  After executing the protocol, the graphics window will open. You can
  select and save the atomic structure of the map asymmetric unit
  writing in the command line:

-  | CASE A: Contacts between any couple of members of the whole
     macromolecule ( (3)):
   | This option allows to get all contacts between all couples of
     members of the macromolecule. In the case of the human we have
     depicted all those possible contacts in the (A).

   The protocol can be used to obtain the contacts depicted. Open this
   protocol ( (1)) and fill in the first (2) in which no symmetry will
   be applied. Include the docked structure (4) as . Use the wizard on
   the right to label the molecule chains (5) as they appear in the
   adjacent window, and execute the protocol.

   After executing the protocol, all atom contacts between the couples

      from a neighbor asymmetric unit of the human haemoglobin .

   The viewer window of the protocol display different results ((A)):

   -  box: Final atomic structure considered to compute contacts that
      can be visualized with . Press the eye (1) to open the structure
      shown on the right.

   -  box: Summary list of all interacting chains, similar to the list
      shown on the right of the (A). Press the eye to open it (2).

   -  box: In addition to the possibility of changing the order of the
      interacting chains in the display, as well as the maximal distance
      between residues to group them, this box allows to select couples
      of interacting chains (4) and inspect in detail the contacts
      between them pressing the eye on the right (3).

-  | CASE B: Contacts between any couple of members of the asymmetric
     unit and ”non-redundant“ contacts between one member of the
     asymmetric unit and another one from the neighbor asymmetric unit (
     (5)). This second asymmetric unit has been obtained by applying
     symmetry with the protocol . Then, “non-redundant” interaction
     means any interaction that can not be inferred by symmetry. The (B)
     shows the total number of interactions of our example. The
     interactions between the chain of the asymmetric unit (model ) and
     the chain of the neighbor asymmetric unit (model ) are symmetric to
     the interactions between chain of the asymmetric unit (model ) and
     chain of the neighbor asymmetric unit (model ). Since those
     interactions can thus be inferred by symmetry, they are “redundant”
     and are absent of the final list of contacts.
   | Similarly to the case A, the protocol form has to be open ( (1) )
     and completed as indicated in the second (3). Include the
     asymmetric unit structure saved with the protocol (6), use the
     wizard on the right (7) to label the chains as it is shown on the
     right and, finally, include the respective type of symmetry of the
     human (8).
   | Like in the case A, after executing the protocol all non-redundant
     atom contacts between any couple of proteins indicated in (B) can
     be visualized by clicking ( (B)). Besides the lower number of
     contacts displayed, remark that a relevant difference between the
     results of the case A and the case B is the final atomic structure
     visualized with , which discriminates between the starting
     asymmetric unit and the second one generated by symmetry.
   | : This second possibility of getting protein contacts observed in
     the case B is extremely useful when you have a big asymmetric unit,
     for example of a virus, and you are interested in contacts among
     proteins within the asymmetric unit and with other adjacent
     asymmetric units.
