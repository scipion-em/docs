CCP4 Refmac protocol
====================

| Protocol designed to refine atomic structures, in reciprocal space,
  regarding electron density maps in by using
  :raw-latex:`\citep{vagin2004}`, :raw-latex:`\citep{kovalevskiy2018}`.
  This protocol integrates functionality in , supporting accession to
  input and output data in the general model building workflow.
| , Refinement of Macromolecular Structures by the Maximum-Likelihood
  method, allows the refinement of atomic models against experimental
  data, and is integrated in CCP4 software suite
  (`www.ccp4.ac.uk/ccp4_projects.php <www.ccp4.ac.uk/ccp4_projects.php>`__).
  Initially applicable to X-ray data, some modifications of also support
  optimal fitting of atomic structures into electron density maps
  obtained from cryo-EM :raw-latex:`\citep{brown2015}`. Particullarly,
  considers a five-Gaussian approximation for electron scatttering
  factors because, unlike of X-rays crystallography, cryo-EM scattering
  is modified by each atom electric charge and ionization state. In
  addition, computes structure factors only for the model-explained part
  of the map. These structure factors are complex because they include,
  not only amplitude data, but also phase information. will try to
  minimize the difference between the “observed” and calculated
  structure factors, computed from cryo-EM maps and from atom
  coordinates (structure), respectively. Additional instructions to use
  can be found in http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/refmac/.

   -  : An electron density map previously downloaded or generated in .
      An atomic structure should be refined regarding to this volume.

   -  : Atomic structure previously downloaded or generated in . This
      structure will be refined according to the electron density
      volume.

   -  : Upper limit of resolution used for refinement, in Angstroms.
      Using double value of sampling rate is recommendable.

   -  : Lower limit of resolution used for refinement, in Angstroms.

   -  : Parameter set to “Yes” by default. With this option, structure
      factors will be computed for the map around model atomic
      structure. Otherwise (option “No”), structure factors will be
      computed for the whole map.

   -  : Advanced parameter that indicates how much around the model
      atomic structure should be cut. 3Å is the default value.

   -  : Radius to compute the mask around the model atomic structure.
      3Å is the default value.

   -  : Cycles of refinement. 30 cycles is the default value.

   -  : Weight parameter between electron density map (experimental
      data) and model atomic structure geometry. Increase this value if
      you want to give more weight to experimental data. If the value is
      set to 0.0, bond root mean square deviation from optimal values
      will be between 0.015 and 0.025.

   -  : Geometrical restriction applied to bonded and nonbonded atom
      pairs. This B factor value set the initial B values.

   -  : This parameter gives the opportunity to add some extra
      parameters. Use “:math:`|`” to separate the next parameter from
      the previous one.

      experimental data and ideal values are disminishing with
      refinement, which is desirable. R factor and Rms BondLength fair
      values should be around 0.3 and 0.02, respectively ().

      -  Resolution limits: 0.0 and the resolution value provided as
         input.

      -  Number of used reflections: Each reflection is defined as the
         common direction that the scattered waves follow, considering
         all the atoms included in a crystallographic unit cell. A
         structure factor will be computed for this common direction.
         The number of reflections is thus identical to the number of
         structure factors.

      -  Percentage observed: Percentage of observed reflections.

      -  Percentage of free reflections: Percentage of reflections
         observed and not included in the refinement process. These
         reflections are used to compute the .

      -  | Overall : Fraction of total differences between observed and
           computed amplitudes of structure factors, previously scaled,
           regarding total observed amplitudes of structure factors.
         | :math:`     R factor = \frac{\sum||F_o|-|F_c||}{\sum|F_o|} 
                `
         | where :math:`|F_o|` is the observed amplitude of the
           structure factor and :math:`|F_c|` is the calculated
           amplitude of the structure factor.

      -  Average Fourier shell correlation: , cross-correlation between
         shells of two 3D volumes in Fourier space, calculated using
         complex Fourier coefficients, divided by the number of
         structure factors in a particular frequency (resolution) shell.
         :math:`FSC_{average}` has the advantage over of being
         independent on weight (related with inverse variances of
         cryo-EM density maps) whenever resolution shells are thin
         enough that the number of structure factors in each shell is
         almost equal :raw-latex:`\citep{brown2015}`.

      -  | Overall weighted : Overall that applies a weight factor to
           differences between observed and computed amplitudes of
           structure factors, and also applies that weight factor to the
           observed amplitudes of structure factors. As in the
           :math:`FSC_{average}`, the weight is related with inverse
           variances of cryo-EM density maps.
         | :math:`           weighted R factor = \frac{\sum(w |F_o|-|F_c||)}{\sum(w |F_o|)}
                `
         | where is the weight factor.

      -  | Overall weighted : Also known as generalised , this factor is
           computed as the root square of the fraction of total squares
           of weighted differences between observed and computed
           amplitudes of structure factors, previously scaled, regarding
           the total of weighted squares of observed amplitudes of
           structure factors.
         | :math:`           weighted R^2 factor = \frac{\sum(w (|F_o|-|F_c||)^2)}{\sum(w (|F_o|)^2)}
                `

         and calculated structure factor amplitudes, taking into account
         only reflections included in the refinement process.

      -  Cruickshank’s for coordinate error: Diffraction precision
         index, useful to estimate atomic placement precision. This
         factor is a function of the number of atoms and reflections
         included in the refinement, of the overall , of the maximum
         resolutions of reflections included in the refinement, as well
         as the completeness of the observed data.
