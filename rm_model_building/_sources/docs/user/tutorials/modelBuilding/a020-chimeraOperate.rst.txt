ChimeraX Operate protocol
=========================

Protocol designed to perform operations with atomic structures in by
using . A volume or set of volumes can also be included. Structures or
maps generated by using this protocol can be saved in after executing
specific commands. protocol constitutes a particular case of this
protocol to perform rigid fitting in by using (Appendix
`[app:chimeraRigidFit] <#app:chimeraRigidFit>`__).

-  Requirements to run this protocol and visualize results:

   -  plugin:

      -  : Optional parameter to be completed with the electron density
         map previously downloaded or generated in .

      -  : Optional parameter to include other electron density maps
         previously downloaded or generated in .

      -  : Atomic structure previously downloaded or generated in .

      -  : Additional atomic structures.

   -  section

      This section contains commands required to save :math:`models`
      according to their reference volumes, which can also be saved if
      required. Remark that using command, session will be saved by
      default, without prejudice that it may be saved with command.
      command allows to merge in only one atomic structure two or more.
      sessions can be restored by using protocol.

-  | Protocol execution:
   | Adding specific protocol label is recommended in section, at the
     form top. To add the label, open the protocol form, press the
     pencil symbol at the right side of box, complete the label in the
     new opened window, press OK and, finally, close the protocol. This
     label will be shown in the output summary content (see below). If
     you want to run again this protocol, do not forget to set to the .
   | Press the red button at the form bottom.
   | graphics window will be opened after executing the protocol.
     Electron density map(s), if loaded, and the atomic structure(s) are
     shown. Steps to follow depend on the specific operation to carry
     out. Usually, new volumes or structures are generated, sometimes by
     combination of others, each one with a specific :math:`model`
     number displayed in the panel, and they have to be saved in .

   -  | To combine two or more atomic structures:
      | Write in command line:
      | and are the respective :math:`model` numbers of two different
        atomic structures. Optionally you can set the :math:`model`
        number of the output combined structure :

   -  | To save a map or an atomic structure generated with this
        protocol with :math:`model` number :
      | Write in command line:
      | Optionally you can write a prefix to easily recognize that map
        or structure. Then, the prefix depends on the user. Example:

   -  Close graphics window.

-  Visualization of protocol results:

   After executing the protocol, press and graphics window will be
   opened by default. Atomic structures and volumes are referred to the
   origin of coordinates in . To show the relative position of atomic
   structures and electron density volumes, the three coordinate axes
   are represented; X axis (red), Y axis (yellow), and Z axis (blue) ().
   Coordinate axes, volume, and atomic structure are model numbers , ,
   and , respectively, in panel. If no volumes have been included,
   coordinate axes and each atomic structure are model numbers and ,
   respectively.

-  | Summary content:

   -  If an atomic structure is generated:

      -  | Protocol output (below framework):
         | ;
         | .
         | Pseudoatoms is set to when the structure is made of
           pseudoatoms instead of atoms. Volume is set to when an
           electron density map is associated to the atomic structure.
