Problem to solve: Haemoglobin
=============================

| The metalloprotein Haemoglobin () is the iron-containing protein able
  to transport oxygen, essential to get energy from aerobic metabolic
  reactions, through red blood cells of almost every vertebrate. The
  first atomic structure of was determined in 1960 by X-ray
  crystallography :raw-latex:`\citep{perutz1960}`. was, alongside
  myoglobin, the first structure solved by this methodology. Due to its
  emblematic prominence in structural biology History, we have selected
  to model its atomic structure.
| is a relatively small macromolecule (molecular weight of 64 KDa) that
  shows C2 symmetry. This heterotetramer is constituted by four globular
  polypeptide subunits, two :math:`\alpha` and two :math:`\beta`
  monomers with 141 and 146 aminoacids in human , respectively. Each
  subunit associates to a prosthetic heme group, that consists in an
  iron (Fe) ion and the heterocyclic ring of porphyrin. Although the
  molecule is able of binding oxygen only in the reduced ferrous status,
  human is commercially distributed in its nonfunctional oxidized ferric
  status as . The atomic structure of the human specimen was inferred by
  :raw-latex:`\citet{khoshouei2017}` for the first time from the
  electron density volume obtained by cryo-EM and using the Volta phase
  plate. The volume, at 3.2Å resolution, and its atomic interpretation
  () are available in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank () and Protein
  Data Bank () with accession numbers and , respectively.
| This tutorial will guide us in the deduction process of the human
  atomic structure using the framework, the 3D map and the protein
  sequences as starting input data, as well as reference atomic
  structures as homologous models in the way indicated in
  :raw-latex:`\citep{martinez2020}`.
