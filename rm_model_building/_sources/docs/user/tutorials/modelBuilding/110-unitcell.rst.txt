Building the asymmetric unit
============================

| Once we have selected the :math:`models` for :math:`\alpha` and
  :math:`\beta` subunits (see the workflow branches to have
  :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` subunits ), we can regenerate the
  smallest asymmetrical element of the starting map. With this aim we
  are going to use protocols to operate with atomic structures ( or ),
  to refine them both manually () and automatically () and to validate
  them ( and ). A brief schema of the main steps of this part of the
  workflow can be seen in . Take into account that in real live probably
  many more steps of refinement and validation will be required.

-  | Protocol to join the :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` subunits in a
     unique atomic structure:
   | Two protocols can be used in for this purpose ( or ) and the result
     should be identical.
   | Before starting, nevertheless, be sure that you have two atomic
     structures and each one includes an only chain with a different .
     Remember that chain may be changed for other chain in and .
   | Secondly, it could be very convenient to change the output label of
     each subunit, in order to follow them easily in . According to the
     go to the Summary of the two final protocols that allow to generate
     those atomic structures and press the black arrow (C) to select the
     option . Type the new output name of the structures ( (D) and (E),
     respectively).

   | Then, open again :math:`ChimeraX` protocol and following the
     already indicated instructions, include the :math:`models` of
     :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` subunits in params and ,
     respectively ( (A)). Firstly, check that both are perfectly fitted
     in the map asymmetric unit. Otherwise, apply the command , as it
     was previously shown. Next, create a single atomic structure by
     joining models and in :math:`ChimeraX` panel. To generate a
     combined write in the command line:
   | The new model is shown in :math:`ChimeraX` panel (). Finally, save
     this fitted structure writing in :math:`ChimeraX` command line:

-  | Protocols to refine the new combined structure generated:
   | At this point refinements could cover specially the overlapping
     area between the two chains. Help yourself with the tools of in the
     main menu, as well as the visualization tools of protocol.

-  | Validation protocols to select the best :math:`model` of the human
     unit cell:
   | Validate the new combined structure generated is recommendable
     before continuing with the next steps in the
     workflow.\ :math:`EMRinger` and
     :math:`Validation CryoEM (MolProbity)` validation statistics should
     be computed for the new :math:`model` of human asymmetric unit,
     generated by combining :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` subunits.
     Appendix `[app:solutions] <#app:solutions>`__
     (**Question**\ `1 <#buildingunitcell>`__\ **\ \_1**) contains a
     statistics table for the unit cell :math:`model` (). We can try to
     improve those statistics by additional refinement processes. By
     performing refinement in real space with :math:`Phenix` some of the
     statistics could result improved. contains also RMSD values
     computed in a similar way as we have seen for :math:`\alpha` and
     :math:`\beta` subunits, considering as fixed structure chains A and
     B from atomic structure. To continue with the modeling process we
     can select the unit cell :math:`model` generated by :math:`Phenix`
     because most of its validation statistics show the best values (,
     :math:`EMRinger` and :math:`MolProbity` values). Exceptionally,
     RMSD regarding the published structure yields the worst value.
