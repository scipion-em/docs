The whole macromolecule
=======================

To regenerate the whole human macromolecule, we are going to follow
basically the schema shown in . Starting from the symmetric unit,
protocol allows to generate the whole molecule by symmetry. As in the
previous step, validation programs drive to selection of the best
:math:`model` of the whole molecule after one or several rounds of
assessment - refinement -assessment. A final validation step will be
accomplished with protocol to assess the volume density occupancy of the
new macromolecule generated.

-  | Protocol to generate the whole molecule of human :
   | Following previous instructions, open protocol ( (1)), load the
     selected atomic structure :math:`model` of asymmetric unit (2), and
     execute the protocol (3). graphics interface will show you the
     :math:`model` of asymmetric unit. Considering the C2 symmetry of
     the whole molecule, write in command line to re-generate the whole
     molecule:
   | A symmetric image of the input :math:`model` (; :math:`model` )
     will be generated. The new :math:`model` contains both the input (,
     )and the symmetric unit ( ).

   | Although the whole structure can be saved by writing in command
     line , in order to have only one and not a group of two , we will
     write in command line:
   | Remark that we have changed the of symmetric chains and by and ,
     respectively.
   | : In this small example selected for modeling it doesn’t matter if
     we model the map asymmetric unit or the whole molecule. In real
     life, however, to model the whole molecule doesn’t make sense
     because of its huge size. In that case, we will limit our modeling
     to the map asymmetric unit. The right modeling of this part of the
     molecule will require to add the adjacent asymmetric units in order
     to perform the appropriate modeling of the overlapping areas,
     avoiding steric classes in the reconstruction by symmetry of the
     whole molecule. In that case, the command lines would be:

   -  | To generate the symmetry copies:

   -  | To remove in the new the symmetry copies with centers within a
        certain range of distance of the center of the molecule input :

   At this point we will continue with the refinement process of this
   asymmetric unit plus neighbors. The validation will focus only in the
   asymmetric unit, which will be recovered by removing the remaining
   adjacent asymmetric units. This cleaning or removing of the neighbor
   units can be performed with the protocol each time we would like to
   validate the structure.

-  | Protocols to refine the new combined structure generated:
   | As we said in the previous chapter regarding the building of the
     asymmetric unit, refinements should cover specially the overlapping
     areas, in this case between the two asymmetric units. Help yourself
     with the tools of in the main menu, as well as the visualization
     tools of protocol.

-  | Validation protocols to select the best :math:`model` of the whole
     human :
   | and :math:`Validation CryoEM (MolProbity)` statistics have to be
     computed for the new :math:`model` of the whole human obtained by
     using protocol (see results in Appendix
     `[app:solutions] <#app:solutions>`__;
     **Question**\ `1 <#wholemacromolecule>`__\ **\ \_1**). Because of
     high values of and , as well as acceptable statistics,
     :math:`model` generated by protocol is selected as :math:`model` of
     the whole human . Additional refinement steps with and do not seem
     to improve the result significantly. In this case, the RMSD value
     of the selected atomic structure :math:`model`, regarding the
     published structure, yields an intermediate value between the best
     and the worst one.

-  | Protocol to assess volume density occupancy:
   | We perform this analysis in order to identify parts of the density
     map that were not modeled previously, maybe unknown parts of the
     complex, although areas where the doesn’t fit the map can be also
     identified. Sometimes the density level or the resolution in these
     areas differ from the rest of the map and commonly are more blurry,
     which makes them much more difficult to identify and trace.
     Ideally, we would like to remove the map density associated to the
     already traced atomic structure to facilitate the modeling of the
     remnant density. Obviously, there are some limitations in this
     process because the structure-derived map might not be absolutely
     identical to the reconstructed map. As one possible aproximation,
     we will run a protocol based on (see Appendix
     `[app:chimeraMapSubtraction] <#app:chimeraMapSubtraction>`__ with
     use cases) to subtract the modeled part of the map from the whole
     map.

   First, open the protocol ( (1)), load both the initial map obtained
   from the reconstruction process (2) and its resolution. Although in
   this case we are going to consider the nominal map resolution, in
   real life you should test different resolution values among which the
   half value of the resolution obtained by FSC is recommended. Include
   also the refined atomic structure :math:`model` of the whole human
   (3). As a control of the subtraction process we are going to remove 7
   residues of the chain . With this aim, use the three wizards on the
   right (4) to select that chain and residues located between positions
   and , both included. Since we are interested in observing differences
   in the whole map, the default option will be maintained regarding the
   selection of a map fraction around the atomic structure (5). Then,
   execute the protocol (6).

   graphics window will open and the commands driving the subtraction
   process will be applied. The shows in blue the map resulting from
   subtracting the -derived map from the starting map after applying a
   Gaussian filter. Three main map bodies can be observed moving the
   density threshold of this map (model in the panel). The red arrow
   number points to the control map derived from removing 7 residues of
   the chain of the atomic structure. The other two red arrows (number )
   point to two unexpected remnant densities.

   The two additional bodies of density should not appear with an
   appropriate modeling of the human showing acceptable validation
   scores. However, in this final of the whole human we didn’t refine on
   purpose the C-terminal ends of chain and its symmetric chain . The
   residues don’t fit to the map density and the remnant densities
   identified in the subtraction protocol correspond to the C-terminal
   ends of chains and . A fair tracing of those parts of the molecule
   would avoid remnant densities others than the control. To check the
   right tracing of the human we have overlapped the above mentioned
   published atomic structure of the human (), in green in the , and our
   final , depicted in pink. The zoom in details the C-terminal end of
   our (red arrow) and the published one (green arrow), which perfectly
   fits the body of density.

   As a conclusion, if you do not have additional densities with the
   example of this tutorial, except the control one, you’d have
   performed a good modeling and you could use your atomic structure to
   perform other types of analyses and to publish it. Otherwise, you
   should still refine your .
