Scipion GUI
===========

This page aims to introduce you in the usage of Scipion GUI. To start
image processing in Scipion we need to run ``scipion`` from the command
line. At first projects manager is displayed and we can create a new
project or select one previously registered (Fig. 1). For this tutorial
we registered projects TestSpiderWorkflow and TestXmippWorkflow for
illustrative purposes (running ``scipion tests tests.em.workflows.test_workflow_spiderMDA`` and
``pyworkflow.tests.em.workflows.test_workflow_xmipp``).

Spider Workflow
---------------

If we open TestSpiderWorkflow project GUI is loaded(Fig 2). To the left
different reconstruction tasks related to Single Particle Analysis (SPA)
are listed. The tree menu is loaded from a configuration file where
protocols are grouped according to base classes, e.g.: Micrographs
Preprocess category displays ProtPreprocessMicrographs protocols. A
protocol is a processing task that involves the execution of several
steps and can be associated to different workflows, e.g.: SPA or Random
Conical Tilt (RCT).

To the right the sequence of protocols executed by the user and its
state (running, finished, aborted) is listed. We can visualize it using
list or tree views. Starting from Scipion version 1.1 it is possible to create
labels associated with different protocols. You can find more details about :doc:`labels here <labels>`.
Also we can edit or copy a protocol (to rerun it),
delete it, see steps or access execution database. 

Bottom right panel displays information for the selected run, such as
inputs and outputs, execution logs or documentation - also provides
``Analyze Results`` button to visualize outputs.

    Figure 2. Project GUI in Protocols Mode

If we switch to Data mode (top right), then left panel displays EM objects registered for
each type and right panel displays project data tree, with protocol
output objects as nodes and edges towards objects used as input. Bottom
right panel displays information for the selected item, that can be
opened using double click. This mode allows us to track image processing
emphasizing on data handling.

    Figure 3. Project GUI in Data Mode

TestSpiderWorkflow project imports a set of particles, preprocess and
aligns them to finally use it as input for different 2D classification
algorithms. If we open filter particles protocol (using edit) the
following form is displayed:

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/filter.png
    :alt: Filter Particles Protocol Form

    Figure 4. Filter Particles Protocol Form


Protocol provides cite references and help util to introduce user on the
subject (Fig. 4-5). Form possess two sections: Run and Input. Run
section is common to all protocols and allows the user to configure run
label and comments (to personalize runs, Fig. 4); execution mode
(restart or resume), host, queue and threads or MPI. Many image
processing tasks are computer expensive so they need to be run on
specific hosts, using queue system and parallel processing.
Parallelization can be supported by underneath algorithm or enabled for
protocols with independent steps.

Input section allows to specify input parameters for the task, like
input particles or filter type. A brief description is provided for all
of them (using help button) and for some a Search GUI to select input
object (Fig. 6) or a wizard GUI (through eye button). Parameters are
showed considering expert level selected (Normal, Advanced or Expert).

We can visualize filtered particles using "Analyze Results" (Fig. 7).
ShowJ viewer is the default viewer for most of Scipion objects, like
images, volumes, sets of images, classes, etc. It can display data in
gallery and table modes and navigate trough different blocks of data.
Also load single images, create subsets, etc. See ShowJ for more detail.
In this project we use it to refine output from a 2D classification
algorithm.

    Figure 8. ShowJ displaying filtered particles

If we select 2D classification protocol ``spider-classify kmeans`` and
open output classes, we can see representative particle for each class
(Fig. 8). Third and fourth items seemed very similar so we can disable
fourth item and create a subset containing only remaining classes. This
operation registers a subset protocol with this classes as input and the
set of classes with enabled items as output.

Xmipp Workflow
--------------

If you open TestXmippWorkflow the following project GUI is displayed
(Fig. 10):

.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/xmipp-project.png
    :alt: TestXmippWorkflow Project GUI

    Figure 10. TestXmippWorkflow Project GUI

This project imports a set of micrographs (eg: Fig. 10), reduce its
image size using downsample and estimates their CTF. Then, picks
particles from micrographs and extracts particles to use it as input for
alignment and classification algorithms like cl2d, ml2d, kendersom or
rotational spectra. We use it to illustrate CTF and particle picking
GUIs.

    Figure 11. ShowJ displaying input micrograph with "gaussian blur" filter applied


ShowJ GUI for single images is displayed above (see Showj)

Screen micrographs produces this output:


.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/ctf2.png
    :alt: CTF Recalculate Wizard

    Figure 12. CTF Recalculate Wizard

We can use CTF wizard to redefine input parameters to recalculate CTF on
specific micrographs. Recalculate CTFs will register a new protocol that
receives this SetOfCTF as input and creates an output set with CTFs
updated.

Particle picking can be done in Scipion using Xmipp, Eman, Bsoft, etc.
In this tutorial we chose Xmipp Particle Picker, see Fig. 12.


.. figure:: /docs/images/guis/picking.png
    :alt: Xmipp Particle Picker GUI

    Figure 13. Xmipp Particle Picker GUI

The Xmipp picker allows us to iterate over the micrographs to pick
particles, see :doc:`Picker<picker>`. After we have done
some manual/supervised picking and feel confident with the results we
register output coordinates into Scipion using Add Coordinates button.
