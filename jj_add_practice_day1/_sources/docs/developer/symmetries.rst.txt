Symmetries
===========================

Overview
========

This page describes the different symmetries
that a polyhedron with fixed center may have
and the symmetry conventions followed by Scipion. There are five fundamental symmetry classes: cyclical, dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral and
icosahedral.

For each type we show in this page:

- Surface rendering of a volume that displays the symmetry.
- Atomic structure file (pb format) containing an atomic structure that
  satisfies the symmetry. (The PDB files may be visualized with
  viewers such as Chimera. `Link </docs/images/Conventions/Symmetry/axis.bild>`_ to chimera axis file).
- Definition including the elements of symmetry.
- *X*, *Y* and *Z* axes are colored in red, yellow and blue respectively.

Note: Is really hard to see the difference symmetries just looking to the images,
instead download the PDB files, the axis.bild file and visualize them in chimera.
In chimera command line type "represent sphere" to increase the atoms size.

Dihedral of order N (Dn)
------------------------

    **Definition**: N rotations of magnitude 360/N degrees around an axis followed by a 180 rotation around a second axis. Both axes are perpendicular.
