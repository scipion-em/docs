Scipion in the cloud
===========================

How to use ScipionCloud
=======================

`ScipionCloud in Amazon Web Services EC2 <scipionCloud-on-amazon-web-services-ec2>`_

`ScipionCloud in EOSC <scipion-on-the-egi-federated-cloud>`_

Cloud-related projects
=======================

ScipionCloud development has been possible thanks to European Horizon 2020, the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme, which has financed the following projects:

EOSC-Life
---------
*“Building a digital space for the life sciences”.*

We participated in Work Package 3 developing one of the Science demonstrators: "`Cryo Electron Microscopy Workflows and Automated Data Deposition <https://www.eosc-life.eu/d2/>`_".

We participate in Work Package 1 Open Call with project for CryoEM data that aims to extend the work done in previous demonstrator in two different aspects: First, by using standard workflow technologies such as Ontologies, Common Workflow Language and RO-Crate packing and second, working on the integration of EGI Datahub (OneData) service to achieve CryoEM data cloudification. This project is a collaboration with CEITEC and Masaryk University from Brno.

MoBrain
--------
*“A Competence Center to Serve Translational Research from Molecule to Brain”.**

We were involved on **Task 2: Cryo-EM in the cloud: bringing clouds to the data**.

`Information about the project <https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/CC-MoBrain>`_

WestLife
---------

*"Bring the world of complex data analysis in Structural Biology to a simple Web browser-based Virtual Research Environment"*.

The group was responsible for the **Integration of existing Cryo-EM web services, Scipion Web Tools, on the VRE**.

Instruct Research and Development pilot project
-----------------------------------------------

Pilot EM cloud Computing was a project to deploy and test Scipion software on AWS EC2 platform and create a public Scipion AMI that could be used by EM users to easily instantiate its own Scipion Virtual Machine on AWS EC2 cloud.

The aim was to have a Scipion AMI that could be used as a stand-alone or as a elastic cluster.
