Prelude
============

Intended audience
-----------------

The recent rapid development of single-particle electron cryo-microscopy
(cryo-EM) allows structures to be solved by this method at almost atomic
resolutions. Providing a basic introduction to model building, this
tutorial shows the initial workflow aimed at obtaining high-quality
atomic models from cryo-EM data by using software framework.

We'd like to hear from you
--------------------------

We have tested and verified the different steps described in this demo
to the best of our knowledge, but since our programs are in continuous
development you may find inaccuracies and errors in the text. Please
let us know about any errors, as well as your suggestions for future
editions, by writing to scipion@cnb.csic.es.

Requirements
------------

This tutorial requires, in addition to *Scipion*, the *CCP4* suite
(http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download/#os=linux) including *refmac*, and *Coot*, and the *PHENIX suite* (https://www.phenix-online.org/download/).
