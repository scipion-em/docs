Structure validation and comparison
===================================

| At the end of the refinement process of *metHgb* :math:`\alpha`
  subunit (a similar one would be required for :math:`\beta` subunit),
  we need to assess the geometry of our :math:`model` regarding the
  starting volume to detect :math:`model` controversial elements or
  :math:`model` parameters that disagree with the map. Although each
  refinement program has their own tools to assess the progress of
  refinement (*Validate* menu; *real space refine* real space
  correlations; *R factor* and *Rms BondLength*), in this tutorial
  section, three assessment tools will be described to obtain
  comparative validation values after using any protocol in the
  workflow: Protocols (, Appendix
  `[app:emRingerProtocol] <#app:emRingerProtocol>`__,
  :raw-latex:`\citep{barad2015}`), (, Appendix
  `[app:molprobityProtocol] <#app:molprobityProtocol>`__,
  :raw-latex:`\citep{davis2004}`), and (, Appendix
  `[app:valCryoEMProtocol] <#app:valCryoEMProtocol>`__,
  :raw-latex:`\citep{afonine2018b}`). protocol will show validation
  values as well as correlation coefficients in real space. Old versions
  of (v. 1.13) do not include this tool. Correlation values in real
  space will thus be computed if a map is provided in protocol.
  Additionally, we are going to introduce the protocol (Appendix
  `[app:superposePdbsProtocol] <#app:superposePdbsProtocol>`__,
  :raw-latex:`\citep{zwartUrl}`) useful to compare visually the geometry
  of two atomic structures.

*Note*: Structure validation is a model building step that you have to
perform recursively during the refinement process to assess if you are
improving your structure or not. Once you finish the refinement process
you’ll obtain the final assessment values. These values should be in a
certain range if you want to submit the atomic structure to databases.
These final validation scores should be computed regarding the density
map that you submit as main map, although during the recursive process
you might have used the sharpened maps for refinement/validation.

Specifically designed for cryo-EM data, tool assesses the appropriate
fitting of a model to a map, validating high-resolution features such as
side chain arrangements. The placement of side chains regarding the
molecule skeleton depends on the :math:`\chi_{1}` dihedral angle (a
dihedral angle is the angle between two intersecting planes), which is
determined by atomic positions of (*N*, *C\ :math:`\alpha`*,
*C\ :math:`\beta`*) and (*C\ :math:`\alpha`*, *C\ :math:`\beta`*,
*C\ :math:`\gamma`*) (see ). The side chain dihedral angles tend to
cluster near :math:`180^\circ` and :math:`\pm60^\circ`. The lower
deviations regarding these values, the better :math:`model`, and the
higher value.

We can start assessing with the *metHgb* :math:`\alpha` subunit
:math:`models` that we have generated along the modeling workflow. In
each case, open the protocol (( (1)), load the extracted map asymmetric
unit (initial or saved with ) (2) and the atomic structure that you’d
like to validate in relation to the map (3), execute the program (4) and
analyze results (5). A menu to check results in detail will be opened
(bar *EMRinger results*). *Phenix EMRinger* plots with density
thresholds, with rolling window for each chain, as well as dihedral
angles for each residue are shown here. The most relevant results,
especially the score, will also be written in the protocol *SUMMARY*
(6).

  :math:`model` geometry and quality at both global and local levels.
  Originally designed to evaluate structures coming from X-Ray
  diffraction and NMR, it does not take into account the quality of the
  fitting with a 3D density map. The implementation of in v. 1.13,
  nevertheless, includes the possibility of adding a volume and
  assessing the correlation in the real space.

  best :math:`model` was obtained from *real space refine* after .
  Considering *score*, the best :math:`model` derives from the whole
  workflow *->* *real space refine*. With *Overall score* as validation
  rule, the last step in the workflow could be suppressed because the
  best value was obtained after *->* *real space refine* (last
  modification of parameters). We’d like to select the best
  :math:`model` and continue refining it in order to improve it as much
  as possible. Assuming that no one :math:`model` is perfect, how can we
  select the best one?

:math:`Model` Comparison
------------------------

The question posed in the previous item does not have an easy answer in
the real world, in which we do not know the final atomic structure. In
this tutorial, nevertheless, we know the atomic structure already
published for this cryo-EM map and we may wonder how far we are from it.
The question can be answered by comparing a) validation statistics that
we have obtained for our :math:`models` with the statistics computed for
the available :math:`\alpha` subunit in *PDB* structure *5NI1*, and b)
the atomic structures themselves by overlapping.

Comparison of validation statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Validation statistics of *metHgb* :math:`\alpha` subunit of *PDB*
structure *5NI1* should be obtained as first step to compare them with
validation statistics of our :math:`models`. With this aim we are going
to follow the workflow remarked in the :

   :alt: framework detailing the last part of the validation workflow.

   framework detailing the last part of the validation workflow.

-  | Protocol :
   | Download from *PDB* structure *5NI1*

-  | Protocol (Appendix `[app:chimeraOperate] <#app:chimeraOperate>`__):
   | Similar to *rigid fit*, *operate* protocol allows to perform
     operations with atomic structures. We are going to use this
     protocol to save independently in the *metHgb* :math:`\alpha`
     subunit. Open the protocol ( (1)), complete the parameter
     *PDBx/mmCIF* including the atomic structure *5NI1* previously
     imported (2), and execute the protocol (3).

   .. figure:: Images/Fig36.pdf
      :alt: Filling in *operate* protocol form.
      :name: fig:chimera_operate_protocol
      :width: 90.0%

      Filling in *operate* protocol form.

   | The graphics window will be opened with the structure *5NI1* as
     model number *#2*. To save independently the structure of human
     *metHgb* :math:`\alpha` subunit (chain A), write in command line:
   | *select #2/A*
   | *save /tmp/5ni1_chainA.cif format mmcif models #2 selectedOnly
     true*
   | *open /tmp/5ni1_chainA.cif*
   | *scipionwrite #3 prefix 5ni1_chainA\_*
   | Remark that the model saved in command line includes both the
     aminoacid chain and the *HEME* group. In case you are interested in
     extracting only the aminoacid chain, you can use the protocol ,
     specifically designed to extract/add individual chains from/to an
     atomic structure (Atomic Structure Chain Operator; Appendix
     `[app:atomStructUtilsOperatorProtocol] <#app:atomStructUtilsOperatorProtocol>`__).
     Compare the results of protocols *operate* and Atomic Structure
     Chain Operator in . The red arrow points at *HEME* group.

-  Protocol :

   | Open *dock in map* protocol and follow the instructions above
     indicated. The structure saved in *operate* will replace this time
     our previous :math:`model`. Results can be observed in .

-  | Protocol : Open again *rigid fit* protocol and, following the
     already indicated instructions, include this time the atomic
     structure *placed_model.cif* generated in the previous step. To fit
     the *metHgb* :math:`\alpha` subunit from 5NI1 structure in the
     extracted asymmetric unit and save the fitting write in command
     line:
   | *fitmap #3 inMap #2*
   | *scipionwrite #3 prefix 5ni1_chainA_fitted\_*

-  Validation protocols and:

   Compute validation statistics with these two protocols for *metHgb*
   :math:`\alpha` subunit from *PDB* structure *5NI1*, write respective
   values in the previous table (), and compare them with the statistics
   of our :math:`models`.

   | Considering results shown in appendix
     `[app:solutions] <#app:solutions>`__
     (**Question**\ `1 <#seq:structurevalidation>`__\ **\ \_2**) for
     *metHgb* :math:`\alpha` subunit, we can conclude that published
     structures are not perfect and we are not very far from this
     published one. In fact, we have overcome every statistic except .
     Nevertheless, the different :math:`models` generated after
     refinement can still be improved by iterative refinement processes.
     Validation statistics thus allow to follow the quality improvement
     of atomic models.

   protocol allows to compare two atomic structures by overlapping them.
   Root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the fixed structure (the
   published one) and one of our :math:`models` supports the
   classification of :math:`models` according to its proximity to the
   published model. Open *superpose pdbs* protocol form ( (1)), include
   the published structure of the *metHgb* :math:`\alpha` subunit as
   fixed structure (2), each one of the :math:`models` generated along
   the worflow (3), execute the protocol (4) and check results by
   pressing *Analyze results* (5). Arrows of remark differing parts
   between the atomic structure of the *metHgb* :math:`\alpha` subunit
   from *PDB* structure *5NI1* (green) and our :math:`model` generated
   by automatic refinement with protocol (pink). By opening these
   structures in you can see the differences between them. Finally,
   complete the with the value of *RMSD (final)* (6) obtained for each
   :math:`model`. (Answers in appendix

| A :math:`model` for *metHgb* :math:`\alpha` subunit has to be selected
  at the end of the validation process. According to the statistics of
  (Appendix `[app:solutions] <#app:solutions>`__;
  **Question**\ `1 <#seq:structurevalidation>`__\ **\ \_2**), select the
  :math:`model` obtained in modeling workflow showing the smallest RMSD
  value, high value of *score*, quite high value of and acceptable
  statistics. Follow a similar process to validate and select the
  :math:`model` generated for *metHgb* :math:`\beta` subunit. Appendix
  `[app:solutions] <#app:solutions>`__
  **Question**\ `1 <#seq:structurevalidation>`__\ **\ \_3** contains a
  statistics table for *metHgb* :math:`\beta` subunit, similar to that
  obtained for *metHgb* :math:`\alpha` subunit.
| In the real world the selected :math:`models` usually are the starting
  point to improve specific validation parameters by additional
  refinement. Since the improvement of certain parameters normally
  implies worsening of other parameters, a final compromise solution has
  to be taken.
