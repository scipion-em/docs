The whole macromolecule
=======================

To regenerate the whole human *metHgb* macromolecule, we are going to
follow basically the schema shown in . Starting from the symmetric unit,
*operate* protocol allows to generate the whole molecule by symmetry. As
in the previous step, validation programs drive to selection of the best
:math:`model` of the whole molecule after one or several rounds of
assessment - refinement -assessment. A final validation step will be
accomplished with *map subtraction* protocol to assess the volume
density occupancy of the new macromolecule generated.

-  | Protocol to generate the whole molecule of human *Hgb*:
   | Following previous instructions, open *operate* protocol ( (1)),
     load the selected atomic structure :math:`model` of *metHgb*
     asymmetric unit (2), and execute the protocol (3). graphics
     interface will show you the :math:`model` of *metHgb* asymmetric
     unit. Considering the C2 symmetry of the whole molecule, write in
     command line to re-generate the whole molecule:
   | *sym #3 C2 copies true*
   | A symmetric image of the input :math:`model` (; :math:`model` *#3*)
     will be generated. The new :math:`model` *#4* contains both the
     input (, *model* *#4.1*)and the symmetric unit (*model* *#4.2*).

      :math:`Model` generated by symmetry for the whole human *metHgb*.

   | Although the whole structure can be saved by writing in command
     line *scipionwrite #4 prefix whole_model\_*, in order to have only
     one *model* and not a group of two *models*, we will write in
     command line:
   | *save /tmp/chains_C_D.cif format mmcif models #4.2*
   | *open /tmp/chains_C_D.cif*
   | *setattr #5/A c chain_id C*
   | *setattr #5/A r chain_id C*
   | *setattr #5/B c chain_id D*
   | *setattr #5/B r chain_id D*
   | *scipioncombine #3,5*
   | *scipionwrite #6 prefix whole_model\_*
   | Remark that we have changed the *ids* of symmetric chains *A* and
     *B* by *C* and *D*, respectively.
   | *Note*: In this small example selected for modeling it doesn’t
     matter if we model the map asymmetric unit or the whole molecule.
     In real life, however, to model the whole molecule doesn’t make
     sense because of its huge size. In that case, we will limit our
     modeling to the map asymmetric unit. The right modeling of this
     part of the molecule will require to add the adjacent asymmetric
     units in order to perform the appropriate modeling of the
     overlapping areas, avoiding steric classes in the reconstruction by
     symmetry of the whole molecule. In that case, the command lines
     would be:

   -  | To generate the symmetry copies:
      | *sym #3 C2 copies true*

   -  | To remove in the new *model* *#4* the symmetry copies with
        centers within a certain range of distance *d* of the center of
        the molecule input *model*:
      | *delete #4 & #3 #>d*

   At this point we will continue with the refinement process of this
   asymmetric unit plus neighbors. The validation will focus only in the
   asymmetric unit, which will be recovered by removing the remaining
   adjacent asymmetric units. This cleaning or removing of the neighbor
   units can be performed with the protocol *operate* each time we would
   like to validate the structure.

-  | Protocols to refine the new combined structure generated:
   | As we said in the previous chapter regarding the building of the
     asymmetric unit, refinements should cover specially the overlapping
     areas, in this case between the two asymmetric units. Help yourself
     with the tools of *Validate* in the main menu, as well as the
     visualization tools of *real space refine* protocol.

-  | Validation protocols to select the best :math:`model` of the whole
     human *Hgb*:
   | and :math:`Validation CryoEM (MolProbity)` statistics have to be
     computed for the new :math:`model` of the whole human *metHgb*
     obtained by using *operate* protocol (see results in Appendix
     `[app:solutions] <#app:solutions>`__;
     **Question**\ `1 <#wholemacromolecule>`__\ **\ \_1**). Because of
     high values of and *score*, as well as acceptable statistics,
     :math:`model` generated by *operate* protocol is selected as
     :math:`model` of the whole human *metHgb*. Additional refinement
     steps with *real space refine* and do not seem to improve the
     result significantly. In this case, the RMSD value of the selected
     atomic structure :math:`model`, regarding the published structure,
     yields an intermediate value between the best and the worst one.

-  | Protocol to assess volume density occupancy:
   | We perform this analysis in order to identify parts of the density
     map that were not modeled previously, maybe unknown parts of the
     complex, although areas where the *model* doesn’t fit the map can
     be also identified. Sometimes the density level or the resolution
     in these areas differ from the rest of the map and commonly are
     more blurry, which makes them much more difficult to identify and
     trace. Ideally, we would like to remove the map density associated
     to the already traced atomic structure to facilitate the modeling
     of the remnant density. Obviously, there are some limitations in
     this process because the structure-derived map might not be
     absolutely identical to the reconstructed map. As one possible
     aproximation, we will run a protocol based on (see Appendix
     `[app:chimeraMapSubtraction] <#app:chimeraMapSubtraction>`__ with
     use cases) to subtract the modeled part of the map from the whole
     map.

   First, open the *map subtraction* protocol ( (1)), load both the
   initial map obtained from the reconstruction process (2) and its
   resolution. Although in this case we are going to consider the
   nominal map resolution, in real life you should test different
   resolution values among which the half value of the resolution
   obtained by FSC is recommended. Include also the refined atomic
   structure :math:`model` of the whole human *metHgb* (3). As a control
   of the subtraction process we are going to remove 7 residues of the
   chain *A*. With this aim, use the three wizards on the right (4) to
   select that chain and residues located between positions *22* and
   *28*, both included. Since we are interested in observing differences
   in the whole map, the default option *No* will be maintained
   regarding the selection of a map fraction around the atomic structure
   (5). Then, execute the protocol (6).

   graphics window will open and the commands driving the subtraction
   process will be applied. The shows in blue the map resulting from
   subtracting the *model*-derived map from the starting map *EMD-3488*
   after applying a Gaussian filter. Three main map bodies can be
   observed moving the density threshold of this map (model *#9* in the
   *Models* panel). The red arrow number *1* points to the control map
   derived from removing 7 residues of the chain *A* of the atomic
   structure. The other two red arrows (number *2*) point to two
   unexpected remnant densities.

   The two additional bodies of density should not appear with an
   appropriate modeling of the human *Hgb* showing acceptable validation
   scores. However, in this final *model* of the whole human *Hgb* we
   didn’t refine on purpose the C-terminal ends of chain *A* and its
   symmetric chain *C*. The *ARG* residues don’t fit to the map density
   and the remnant densities identified in the subtraction protocol
   correspond to the C-terminal ends of chains *A* and *C*. A fair
   tracing of those parts of the molecule would avoid remnant densities
   others than the control. To check the right tracing of the human
   *Hgb* we have overlapped the above mentioned published atomic
   structure of the human *Hgb* (*PDB ID 5NI1*), in green in the , and
   our final *model*, depicted in pink. The zoom in details the
   C-terminal end of our *model* (red arrow) and the published one
   (green arrow), which perfectly fits the body of density.

   As a conclusion, if you do not have additional densities with the
   example of this tutorial, except the control one, you’d have
   performed a good modeling and you could use your atomic structure to
   perform other types of analyses and to publish it. Otherwise, you
   should still refine your *model*.
