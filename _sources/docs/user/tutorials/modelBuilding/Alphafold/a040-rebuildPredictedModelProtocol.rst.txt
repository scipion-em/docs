Phenix Rebuild Predicted Model protocol
=======================================

*PHENIX*-based protocol designed to rebuild models predicted by AlphaFold2 :cite:p:`jumper2021`, RoseTTAFold :cite:p:`baek2021` and other predicted models in *Scipion*. According to `PHENIX documentation <https://phenix-online.org/version_docs/dev-4380/reference/rebuild_predicted_model.html>`_ the tool *rebuild_predicted_model* uses, in addition to the starting prediction model, a set of docked domains from the predicted model as template. These docked domains should correspond to the accurate parts of the model that have to be fitted according to map restrains. The model will be morphed to match the docked domains. Residues between domains are strectched to span the gap, serving as markers of the chain tracing. Then several methods contribute to rebuild each docked domain and connecting loops. The final model should have to be refined at the end of the process.

-  | Requirements to run this protocol and visualize results:

   -  | *Scipion* plugin: **scipion-em**

   -  | *Scipion* plugin: **scipion-em-phenix**

   -  | **PHENIX software suite** (tested for version 1.20.1-4487)

   -  | *Scipion* plugin: **scipion-em-chimera**

-  | *Scipion* menu: *Model building -> Flexible fitting*  (:numref:`model_building_app_protocol_rebuild_prediction_1` (A))

      Protocol **phenix-rebuild predicted model**. A: Protocol location in *Scipion* menu. B: Protocol form.

-  | Protocol form parameters (:numref:`model_building_app_protocol_rebuild_prediction_1` (B)):

   | *Input* section:

   -  | *Predicted AlphaFold2 model*: Any atom structure that the user would like to process. It can be generated as AlphaFold2 prediction through the *Scipion* protocol **chimerax-alphafold prediction** (See Appendix :ref:`AlphaFold2 Initial Model Prediction <app:alphafoldPredictionProtocol>`) or generated outside *Scipion*. In this last case, the predicted atom structure has to be imported previously (look at Appendix :ref:`Import atomic structure <app:importAtomicStructure>`). 

   -  | *Docked AlphaFold2 model*: Usually the output of the protocol **phenix-dock predicted model**. This model is normally constituted by a single chain with gaps for the less accurate parts of the model. 

   -  | *Input map*: Electron density map previously downloaded or generated in *Scipion* to fit the atomic structure.

   -  | *High-resolution limit (Ã…)*: Electron density map resolution.

   -  | *Number of threads*: Advanced param. Depending on the size of *map* and *model*, and the number of *models* to fit the process could be quite slow and you can accelerate it by increasing the number of threads.

   -  | *Extra Params*: Advanced param. Look at `PHENIX documentation <https://phenix-online.org/version_docs/dev-4380/reference/rebuild_predicted_model.html>`_ page to include additional params with the appropriate syntaxis.

-  Protocol execution:

   | Adding specific protocol label is recommended in *Run name*
     section, at the form top. To add the label, open the protocol form,
     press the pencil symbol at the right side of *Run name* box,
     complete the label in the new opened window, press OK and, finally,
     close the protocol. This label will be shown in the output summary
     content (see below). If you want to run again this protocol, do not
     forget to set to *Restart* the *Run mode*.

   | Press the *Execute* red button at the form bottom.

-  | Visualization of protocol results:

   | After executing the protocol, press *Analyze Results* in the *Scipion* framework and the *ChimeraX* graphics window will be opened. Atomic structures and volumes are referred to the origin of coordinates in *ChimeraX*. To show the relative position of atomic structures and electron density volume, the three coordinate axes are represented; X axis (red), Y axis (yellow), and Z axis (blue) (:numref:`model_building_app_protocol_volume_3`). Coordinate axes, map, initial predicted model, fitted atomic structure (suffix *.pdb.pdb*) and rebuilt model (suffix *.pdb.pdb.pdb*) are model numbers *#1*, *#2*, *#3*, *#4* and *#5*, respectively, in *ChimeraX Models* panel. Initial model residues predicted by AlphaFold2 are colored according to the alphafold bfactor (*LDDT* values) palette of *ChimeraX* (model #3).

-  | Summary content:

   -  | Protocol output (below framework):
      | *phenix - rebuild predicted model -> ouputPdb*;
      | *AtomStruct (pseudoatoms=True/ False, volume=True/ False)*.
      | Pseudoatoms is set to *True* when the structure is made of
        pseudoatoms instead of atoms.
