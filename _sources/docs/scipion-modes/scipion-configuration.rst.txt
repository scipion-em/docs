=====================
Scipion configuration
=====================
In Scipion3 configuration step is optional. Without a configuration file, scipion and the plugins
will run with default values and what is available in the system (usually what is exposed with PATH
and LD_LIBRARY_PATH).

If you want to know what are the default values type:

::

    scipion3 printenv

If default values do not work for you, you are going to need a config file.
Such cases include customising installation of some binaries  (xmipp, relion), using a specific MPI
or CUDA version or telling a plugin to use a specific binary version.

A special case is when you install Scipion3 on a cluster. For this you are going
to need a :ref:`host file <host-configuration>`.

Running scipion3 config
=======================
Below is the command used to generate config files or analyze them if you already have them.

::

    scipion3 config

The configuration files generated with this command are in one location:

* ``<your-scipion-home>/config`` contains configuration files for this Scipion installation,
  which will be applied to everyone using it. There are three files stored here:

        - ``scipion.conf`` with general variables to run scipion,
          install and use external libraries, etc. Also, all plugin-defined variables will be
          added for those plugins already installed.
        - ``hosts.conf`` with the host configuration.
          You can find more about it on the :ref:`host configuration page <host-configuration>`.
        - ``protocols.conf`` with the protocols tree definition.

* ``~/.config/scipion/scipion.conf`` will be read if present but Scipion3 will never generate this file.
This could be useful if you want to overwrite global Scipion3 configuration.

For example, below is an excerpt of
``config/scipion.conf`` adapted for Ubuntu:

::

    [PYWORKFLOW]
    SCIPION_DOMAIN = pwem
    SCIPION_FONT_NAME = Helvetica
    SCIPION_LOG = ~/ScipionUserData/logs/scipion.log
    SCIPION_NOTIFY = True
    SCIPION_SOFTWARE = ${SCIPION_HOME}/software
    (...)

    [PLUGINS]
    CCP4_HOME = %(EM_ROOT)s/ccp4-7.0.056
    CHIMERA_HOME = %(EM_ROOT)s/chimerax-1.0
    CISTEM_HOME = %(EM_ROOT)s/cistem-1.0.0-beta
    (...)

Notice that in the excerpt above, ``CCP4_HOME``, ``CHIMERA_HOME`` and ``CISTEM_HOME``
are set to a certain path, determining a certain version. On the other hand, the
variables that are not defined here will remain by default and a plugin update will
eventually update them.

Run

::

    scipion3 config -p pluginPackage

to see the plugin-variables associated to a certain plugin.
Note that ``pluginPackage`` is the package name of the plugin,
check :ref:`the plugin's packages list <Plugins-API>`
(e.g. ``xmipp3`` is the package name for the ``scipion-em-xmipp`` plugin)

Once ``config/scipion.conf`` is edited, run ``scipion3 config`` again
to make some checks.

If you have configuration files from previous installations, you may
want to use this instead (consider to make a backup of your config files before):

::

    scipion3 config --overwrite

Check also the `Xmipp documentation on the configuration <https://github.com/I2PC/xmipp/wiki/Xmipp-configuration-(version-20.07)>`_.


GPU variables
=============

Scipion itself is not compiling/running anything on GPU but it can provide some
configuration to its plugins and their binaries. Scipion is always passing the
``PATH`` and the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` present during the Scipion launching time.
However, a certain CUDA toolkit can be set at ``config/scipion.conf``.

For instance,

::

    CUDA_BIN = /usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin
    CUDA_LIB = /usr/local/cuda-10.1/lib64

where ``CUDA_BIN`` is intended only for compiling purposes (it should contain
the ``nvcc`` compiler) and ``CUDA_LIB`` will be added to the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.

In addition, plugins can define its own CUDA config variables in order to be able
to use a different CUDA toolkit from one plugin to the other. Then, one can set
some of the following config variables at ``config/scipion.conf``

::

    XMIPP_CUDA_BIN = None  # Only for compiling purposes (overrides CUDA_BIN)
    XMIPP_CUDA_LIB = None  # Fill to override scipion CUDA_LIB
    RELION_CUDA_BIN = None  # Only for compiling purposes (overrides CUDA_BIN)
    RELION_CUDA_LIB = None  # Fill to override scipion CUDA_LIB
    GAUTOMATCH_CUDA_LIB = None  # Fill to override scipion CUDA_LIB
    GCTF_CUDA_LIB = None  # Fill to override scipion CUDA_LIB
    MOTIONCOR2_CUDA_LIB = None  # Fill to override scipion CUDA_LIB

Check also the `Xmipp-CUDA documentation <https://github.com/I2PC/xmipp/wiki/Xmipp-configuration-(version-20.07)#cuda-configuration>`_.

MPI variables
=============

Scipion uses ``mpi4py`` to launch different steps in parallel and doesn't require
any additional configuration to do that
(see :ref:`host configuration page <host-configuration>` for more details).
However, Scipion can provide MPI configuration to its plugins and their binaries/compilations
by setting the following variables in the ``config/scipion.conf``

::

    MPI_BINDIR = /usr/lib64/mpi/gcc/openmpi/bin
    MPI_LIBDIR = /usr/lib64/mpi/gcc/openmpi/lib
    MPI_INCLUDE = /usr/lib64/mpi/gcc/openmpi/include

Check also the `Xmipp-MPI documentation <https://github.com/I2PC/xmipp/wiki/Xmipp-configuration-(version-20.07)#mpi-configuration>`_.

JAVA variables
==============

Scipion uses ShowJ from Xmipp for visualization proposes and ShowJ is coded in
Java. For that, ``java`` command must be visible to launch ShowJ and visualize
viewers. In addition, Xmipp will look for java libs during compilation to be
able to generate the ShowJ programs.

You can set a certain java toolkit with the following config variables in
``config/scipion.conf``

::

    JAVA_HOME = /usr/lib/jvm/java-*  # Fill * with your java version
    JAVA_BINDIR = %(JAVA_HOME)s/bin
    JAR = %(JAVA_BINDIR)s/jar
    JAVAC = %(JAVA_BINDIR)s/javac
    JNI_CPPPATH = %(JAVA_HOME)s/include:%(JAVA_HOME)s/include/linux

Check also the `Xmipp-Java documentation <https://github.com/I2PC/xmipp/wiki/Xmipp-configuration-(version-20.07)#java-configuration>`_.


OpenCV flag
===========

To install Xmipp without OpenCV and, then skipping the programs using it
(Optical Alignment and Volume Enrich),
you can set OPENCV to False in ``scipion.conf``:

::

    OPENCV = False

Check also the `Xmipp-OpenCV documentation <https://github.com/I2PC/xmipp/wiki/Xmipp-configuration-(version-20.07)#opencv-configuration>`_.



Running Scipion in multi-users environment
==========================================

In the case you want to install Scipion for multiple users, it is
convenient to have a single ``scipion.conf`` file for all of them, otherwise,
each user must have a config file under his home folder as described above (*TODO: Is this according scipion3?*).

We can launch Scipion with the ``--config </path/to/a/specific/scipion.conf>`` parameter.
This parameter tells Scipion to use a configuration file placed in a specific path and **only** that one.

NOTE: Scipion3 installer creates a launcher (python script) called scipion3. That file is
good place to enforce using a common config file:

Fragment of scipion3 script:

::

    (...)
    cmd += "python -m scipion --config  <scipion.conf PATH> %s" % " ".join(sys.argv[1:])
    (...)

To fix the config from the console

::

    scipion3 --config <scipion.conf PATH>
