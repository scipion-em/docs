-------------------------------------

If you are new to Scipion, you will find useful to follow this steps:

1.  Read the `project definition <project-definition>`_. After this, you
    should have a better idea of the context of our work and what Scipion is
    and which are the motivations behind. Don't worry if you feel a bit lost
    with so much information, you can read this again.
2.  Read the `Scipion Architecture <architecture>`_ to have an idea
    of the "big picture" of the project. You should know the basic
    components of Scipions and how they interact.

    your hands dirty with some source code compilation and installations.

    in Scipion. Eclipse is the IDE that we use, but you are also free to
    select your preferred one.
5.  Read some `basic tips about git <how-to-git>`_. We use *git* as our
    versioning system, so it will be useful to have a basic knowledge about
    it.

    The style is very important in order to write clear and readable code as
    a team.

    messages, etc.
